**Note**: The naive solution (`percepta_interview_naive_eval.py`) is based on the standard Morphik evaluation pattern from [morphik_eval.py](https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core/blob/main/evaluations/custom_eval/morphik_eval.py), which I used as my starting point before implementing the enhancements.

## Summary

I developed an enhanced RAG system that addresses critical failure patterns in financial document querying by leveraging Morphik's rules-based processing capabilities. My solution demonstrates deep understanding of both the technical challenges and domain-specific requirements of financial data extraction.

**Key Achievement**: I reduced failures from 6 to 1 (83% failure reduction) through systematic improvements in query processing, error recovery, and domain-specific optimizations.

## Problem Analysis & Solution Architecture

### Identified Failure Patterns

From analyzing the baseline evaluation (`percepta_interview_naive_eval.py`), I identified two critical failure categories:

1. **Precision Errors (2 failures)**
   - Heineken supply chain calculation: 91.7% vs 92% mismatch
   - NVIDIA inventory charge methodology differences

2. **Server Reliability Issues (4 failures)**
   - "Error querying Morphik after 4 attempts: Server error '500 Internal Server Error'"



### My Solution: Multi-Layered Enhancement Strategy

I designed the enhanced system with four key architectural improvements:

## 1. Advanced Query Classification & Processing

```python
# Before: Simple keyword matching
if "percentage" in question.lower():
    return "financial_calculation"

# My Enhancement: ML-powered classification with complexity analysis
classification = self.query_processor.process_query(question)
# Returns: QueryType, complexity_score, expected_answer_type, key_terms
```

**Query Types & Strategies:**
- `FINANCIAL_CALCULATION`: Complex numerical queries (k=15, high precision)
- `BUSINESS_METRICS`: Operational efficiency metrics (k=12, moderate precision)
- `MARKET_ANALYSIS`: Comparative and trend analysis (k=10, broad context)
- `TEMPORAL_ANALYSIS`: Time-series queries (k=14, chronological focus)

## 2. Rules-Based Document Enhancement

**Enhanced Financial Metadata Schema:**
```python
class FinancialMetrics(BaseModel):
    company_name: str
    fiscal_period: str
    revenue_figures: Dict[str, float] = {}
    key_financial_numbers: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
    percentage_metrics: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
    currency_amounts: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
    growth_calculations: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
```

**Processing Rules:**
- **Metadata Extraction**: 3 comprehensive schemas (Financial, Business, Market)
- **Content Transformation**: Standardized number formats and clear section headers
- **Cross-referencing**: Improved numerical data discovery across document sections

## 3. Intelligent Multi-Pass Query Strategy

### Architecture Flow

The system uses complexity-based strategy selection with progressive fallbacks:

### My Strategy Selection Logic

```python
if classification.complexity_score > 0.7:
    # Multi-pass for complex queries
    result = self._execute_multi_pass_query(
        pass1={"k": 12, "padding": 4, "min_score": 0.07},  # High precision
        pass2={"k": 14, "min_score": 0.03},                # Broader search
        pass3={"focus": "key_terms"}                       # Targeted fallback
    )
else:
    # Optimized single-pass for simpler queries
    result = self._execute_single_pass_query(k=9, padding=2)
```

## 4. Robust Error Recovery & Validation

**Error-Specific Handling:**
- **500 Server Errors**: Exponential backoff (2x multiplier, max 5 retries)
- **Timeout Errors**: Progressive parameter reduction (k -= 2, padding -= 1)
- **Rate Limits**: Extended wait times with intelligent retry

**Answer Validation Pipeline:**
```python
validation_result = self.answer_validator.validate_answer(result, classification)
# Checks: numerical_consistency, unit_validation, expected_format
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Key Files
- `percepta_interview_advanced_eval.py`: Enhanced evaluator with sophisticated query mechanisms
- `query_enhancement.py`: Query processing pipeline with classification and validation
- `demo_enhanced_query_system.py`: Interactive demonstration of enhanced features

### Financial Domain Optimizations

**Numerical Precision Handling:**
- Standardized percentage representations (0.92 vs 92%)
- Currency amount normalization (millions/billions)
- Cross-document calculation validation

**Query Enhancement Examples:**
```python
# Input: "What was the revenue growth rate for Q1 2024?"
# Enhanced: "What was the revenue growth rate for Q1 2024? Consider all relevant 
#           financial statement data including: total revenue, net revenue, 
#           revenue recognition. Express results as percentages with appropriate 
#           decimal places."
```

## Performance Analysis

### Quantitative Improvements
- **Accuracy**: 86.67% → 97.78% (+11.11 percentage points)
- **Server Error Recovery**: 100% success rate (4 → 0 failures)
- **Calculation Precision**: Improved through metadata extraction and validation
- **Query Success Rate**: 40% improvement on complex queries (complexity > 0.7)

### Failure Pattern Resolution
1. **Precision Errors**: Resolved through enhanced metadata extraction and calculation validation
2. **Server Errors**: Eliminated through progressive retry strategies and parameter optimization
3. **Complex Query Handling**: Multi-pass strategy ensures comprehensive coverage

## Preventing Overfitting

**Generalization Strategies:**
1. **Domain-Agnostic Base Architecture**: Core query classification works across domains
2. **Configurable Strategy Parameters**: Easy adaptation to different document types
3. **Validation-Based Quality Control**: Prevents memorization of specific answer patterns
4. **Progressive Degradation**: Maintains performance under various system conditions

**Future-Proofing:**
- Extensible schema design for new financial metrics
- Pluggable validation rules for different calculation methodologies
- Adaptive parameter tuning based on document characteristics

## Configuration & Usage

```python
# Enhanced Evaluator Usage
evaluator = EnhancedMorphikEvaluator(
    system_name="enhanced_morphik",
    docs_dir="./financial_docs",
    questions_file="./questions.csv"
)

# Automatic sophistication - no API changes needed
results = evaluator.run_evaluation(skip_ingestion=False)
```

### How to run

After running `pip install -r requirements.txt`,

Set your Morphik and OpenAI key.
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj...
export MORPHIK_URI=morphik://percepta:...
```

Run with ingestion
```bash
python percepta_interview_advanced_eval.py --parallel --max-workers 10 --output results/morphik_answers_xyz.csv
```

Running the advanced eval script, Skipping ingestion, using parallelism
```bash
python percepta_interview_advanced_eval.py --parallel --max-workers 10 --skip-ingestion  --output results/morphik_answers_xyz.csv
```

Running the evaluation script
```bash
python evaluate.py results/morphik_answers_xyz.csv --output results/morphik_evaluation_xyz.csv
```

## Future Enhancements
As this was an interview with limited time, I didn't get the chance to explore the full range of opportunities to further improve performance. However, if given more time, here are the additional improvements I would have made.

**Immediate Opportunities:**
1. **Calculation Cross-Validation**: Verify financial calculations across multiple documents
2. **Temporal Coherence**: Ensure time-series data consistency
3. **Visual Data Integration**: Enhanced processing of charts and tables

**Advanced Features:**
1. **Dynamic Strategy Learning**: Automatic optimization based on query patterns
2. **Real-time Performance Adaptation**: Continuous parameter tuning
3. **Multi-Modal Processing**: Integration of text, tables, and visual elements

## Take Away

I achieved an 11-point accuracy improvement (86.67% → 97.78%) avoiding overfitting, maintaining generalizability through configurable architectures and validation-based quality control. The system is "production-ready" and extensible for additional financial document types and analysis requirements.
