## 1. Year-Over-Year Growth Rates (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)

| Metric                                            | Q1 2024 base    | Q1 2025 result  | Y/Y Growth | Source/Slide                              |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Total revenue                                     | \$634 M         | \$884 M         | +39%       | “Total revenue grew 39% Y/Y” (Financials) |
| Total revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts| \$610 M¹        | \$879 M¹        | +44%       | “Total revenue excluding … grew 44% Y/Y”  |
| US revenue                                        | \$406 M²        | \$628 M²        | +55%       | “US revenue grew 55% Y/Y to \$628 M”      |

¹ From Appendix “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” (634,338–23,898 = 610,440; 883,855–5,147 = 878,708)  
² From the US Revenue Growth chart (\$406 M → \$628 M)

### 1.1 Standard Deviation of Those Y/Y Rates

Let the three rates be [39, 44, 55] %, then

- mean μ = (39+44+55)/3 = 46 %  
- variance σ² = [(39–46)² + (44–46)² + (55–46)²] / 3  
             = (49 + 4 + 81) / 3  
             ≈ 44.67  
- σ ≈ √44.67 ≈ **6.7 percentage points**

## 2. Rule-of-40 Quarter-Over-Quarter Changes (Q2 2023 → Q1 2025)

From the Appendix “Reconciliation of Rule of 40”:

Quarter | Rule of 40  
------- | ---------  
Q2 2023 | 38%  
Q3 2023 | 46%  
Q4 2023 | 54%  
Q1 2024 | 57%  
Q2 2024 | 64%  
Q3 2024 | 68%  
Q4 2024 | 81%  
Q1 2025 | 83%  

Compute Q-on-Q deltas:

- Q3 23–Q2 23: 46–38 = +8  
- Q4 23–Q3 23: 54–46 = +8  
- Q1 24–Q4 23: 57–54 = +3  
- Q2 24–Q1 24: 64–57 = +7  
- Q3 24–Q2 24: 68–64 = +4  
- Q4 24–Q3 24: 81–68 = +13  
- Q1 25–Q4 24: 83–81 = +2  

List of changes = [8, 8, 3, 7, 4, 13, 2]

### 2.1 Standard Deviation of Q-on-Q Changes

- mean δ = (8+8+3+7+4+13+2)/7 ≈ 6.43  
- variance = Σ(δᵢ–6.43)² / 7 ≈ 12.25  
- σ ≈ √12.25 ≈ **3.5 percentage points**

---

## 3. Relating Volatility to Q1 2025 Rule of 40 (83%)

- **Absolute level:** Q1 2025’s 83% Rule of 40 is well above both the 40% “hurdle” line and the eight-quarter average of ≈71%.  
- **Volatility context:**  
  - Y/Y revenue‐growth rates (39%, 44%, 55%) vary with σ≈6.7 pp, indicating moderate dispersion across revenue measures.  
  - The Rule of 40 itself moves more steadily quarter-to-quarter (σ≈3.5 pp).  
- **Interpretation:** The relatively low Q-on-Q volatility of the Rule of 40 underscores a smooth, upward trend in Palantir’s combined growth + profitability metric, culminating in the Q1 25 peak of 83%. In other words, while revenue‐growth rates swing by ±7 pp around their mean, the Rule of 40 has been even more stable, reinforcing confidence in the quality of the Q1 25 result.

"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Here’s how we arrive at the change in operating expense per U.S. commercial customer from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025:

1.  Pull the two key line items for each quarter from the Appendix:

    | Metric                                     | Q1 2024            | Q1 2025            |
    |--------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
    | Revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts  
       (Appendix – Revenue Excl. Strategic Contracts)  
                                                | \$610,440 k        | \$878,708 k        |
    | Adjusted operating income  
       (Appendix – Reconciliation to Adjusted Op. Income)  
                                                | \$226,458 k        | \$390,710 k        |

2.  Compute **total operating expense** (non-GAAP) for the quarter as  
    Operating Expense = Revenue Excl. Strat. Contracts – Adjusted Op. Income  

    – Q1 2024:  
      610,440 − 226,458 = 383,982 (\$ thousands)  
    – Q1 2025:  
      878,708 − 390,710 = 487,998 (\$ thousands)

3.  Divide each operating‐expense figure by the **U.S. commercial customer count**  
    (trailing-twelve-months ended Mar 31, from “US Commercial Customer Count” slide):

    | Quarter         | TTM U.S. Commercial Customers | Operating Expense (\$ k) | Expense / Customer (\$ k) |
    |-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
    | Q1 2024 (TTM 3/31/24) | 262                           | 383,982                  | 383,982 ÷ 262 ≈ 1,466      |
    | Q1 2025 (TTM 3/31/25) | 432                           | 487,998                  | 487,998 ÷ 432 ≈ 1,130      |

4.  Finally, calculate the year-over-year change:

    % Δ = (1,130 − 1,466) ÷ 1,466 ≈ −0.229 ⇒ **−23%**

**Answer:**  
Operating expense per U.S. commercial customer fell from \$1.466 million in Q1 2024 to \$1.130 million in Q1 2025, a **22.9% decrease** year-over-year.

"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1) Change in Total Other Assets  
- As of January 26, 2025, “Other assets” (long-term) were $6,425 million; as of April 27, 2025, they were $6,788 million.  
- Increase = $6,788 M − $6,425 M = **$363 million**.  
- (See “Other Assets (Long Term)” table, Note in Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, p. 14.)

2) Increase in Assumed-Liability Acquisitions  
- Q1 FY 2026 assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets: $408 million  
- Q1 FY 2025 assumed-liability acquisitions: $147 million  
- Increase = $408 M − $147 M = **$261 million**.  
- (See “Property and Equipment” footnote, Note — first quarter assumed-liability acquisitions, p. 14.)

3) Intangible-Asset Amortization as a Percentage of Q1 FY 2026 Acquisitions  
- Q1 FY 2026 amortization expense on intangible assets: $159 million.  
- Percentage of the $408 million acquisitions = 159 ÷ 408 ≈ **38.97%** (≈39%).

"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","**Answer:**  
The fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment on April 27, 2025 was **\$1,000 million**, while the reclassification adjustment out of non-marketable equity securities (into marketable securities) in Q1 FY26 was **\$843 million**.  Thus, the fair value **exceeded** the carrying-value reclassification by **\$157 million**.

---

### Detail and Context

1. **Fair value of CoreWeave (Apr 27, 2025)**  
   From Note 5 (Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities):  
   > “The fair value of the [CoreWeave] investment as of April 27, 2025 was \$1 billion and is subject to a short-term restriction on the ability to sell.”¹  

2. **Reclassification adjustment (Q1 FY26)**  
   From Note 6 (Non-marketable Equity Securities):  
   > Adjustments related to non-marketable equity securities (Three Months Ended Apr 27, 2025) –  
   > • Reclassification(1): **\$(843 million)**  
   >  
   > (1) In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, our investment in CoreWeave was reclassified from non-marketable equity securities to marketable securities following public market trading.²  

3. **Difference**  
   Fair value \$1,000 M − reclassification \$843 M = **\$157 million**

---

### Market Performance Data & Comparative Analysis

- Upon its public trading debut, CoreWeave’s equity was marked to market at \$1 billion, substantially higher than its prior carrying basis in long-term “other assets.”
- During Q1 FY26, NVIDIA recognized net unrealized losses of \$222 million on its publicly-held equity portfolio (driven in part by other holdings), yet CoreWeave bucked that trend with a positive mark-to-market gain upon reclassification.
- Comparatively, the \$843 million reclassification adjustment represents the cumulative carrying value removed from non-marketable securities, while the \$157 million positive spread reflects the immediate mark-to-market uplift on reclassification.

---

### Forward-Looking & Forecast Considerations

- **Short-term liquidity:** The \$1 billion position remains subject to a short-term sales restriction, limiting immediate monetization but preserving upside as CoreWeave scales its AI-compute offerings.  
- **Volatility outlook:** Given the broader tech market’s volatility (notably, NVIDIA’s net unrealized losses on other listed shares of \$222 million in Q1 FY26), CoreWeave’s fair value may continue to fluctuate with market sentiment around AI-infrastructure assets.  
- **Analyst expectations:** Industry forecasts anticipate robust growth in GPU-cloud services, potentially driving further appreciation in CoreWeave’s public valuation. NVIDIA management will reassess fair-value classification each quarter, with any additional unrealized gains or losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net.”

"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Below is the detail you requested, based on the (false) assumption that the 83% “Rule of 40” in Q1 2025 was computed as:

  Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin + US Government Revenue Q/Q Growth 

1. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin  
   • Value: 42%  
   • Calculation:  Adjusted Free Cash Flow ($370 million) ÷ Total Revenue for Q1 2025 ($884 million)  
   • Reference:  
     – “Q1 2025 Highlights” slide: “Adjusted free cash flow of $370 million; 42% margin”  
     – Appendix “Reconciliation of Cash Flow from Operating Activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin”  

2. US Government Revenue Quarter-over-Quarter Growth  
   • Value: +9%  
   • Calculation:  (Q1 2025 US Government revenue – Q4 2024 US Government revenue) ÷ Q4 2024 US Government revenue  
   • Reference:  
     – “Q1 2025 Highlights” slide: “US government revenue grew +45% Y/Y and +9% Q/Q to $373 million”  
     – “US Government Revenue Growth” slide  

3. Quarter-End Balance in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and US Treasury Securities  
   • Value: $5.4 billion  
   • Reference:  
     – “Cash from Operations and Adjusted Free Cash Flow” slide (left panel): “We ended Q1 2025 with $5.4 B in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities and no debt.”  

4. Deals of at Least $1 Million Closed in Q1 2025  
   • Value: 139 deals  
   • Reference:  
     – “Q1 2025 Highlights” slide: “Closed 139 deals of at least $1 million, 51 deals of at least $5 million, and 31 deals of at least $10 million.”  

5. US Commercial Customer Count (TTM ended March 31, 2025)  
   • Value: 432 customers  
   • Reference:  
     – “US Commercial Customer Count” slide (TTM ended Mar 31 2025 bar: 432; +65% Y/Y, +13% Q/Q)  

Under this (incorrect) summation, one would get 42% + 9% = 51%, not the 83% Rule of 40 shown on the “Rule of 40” slide."
"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","**Answer Summary**  
The “other income” combination (net change in unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities plus total other income (expense), net) grew faster year-over-year (YoY) than the “non-cash add-backs” combination (stock-based compensation expense plus depreciation & amortization) by approximately **23 percentage-points** (70% vs. 47%).

## 3. Faster Growth & Percentage-point Difference  
- Non-cash add-backs grew **46.7% YoY**  
- Unrealized gains + other income grew **69.8% YoY**  
- **Difference** = 69.8% – 46.7% ≈ **23.1 percentage points**  

**Conclusion**  
The combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net grew faster (≈70%) than the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation & amortization in operating cash flows (≈47%), exceeding it by roughly **23 percentage points**."
"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","Here’s what the 10-Q actually shows for Q1 of fiscal 2026 (ended April 27, 2025) versus the same quarter a year ago (ended April 28, 2024):

1.  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (page 7 of the 10-Q)  
    •  Net cash provided by operating activities, Q1 FY26:  $27,414 million  
    •  Net cash provided by operating activities, Q1 FY25:  $15,345 million  
    →  Year-over-year change: 27,414 – 15,345 = **+$12,069 million**  

2.  Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion (page 28 of the 10-Q)  
    “Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, due to higher revenue and timing of cash collections.”

Calculation method and references:  
–  We simply subtract the Q1 FY25 line item from Q1 FY26 in the “Net cash provided by operating activities” row of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Three Months Ended Apr 27, 2025 vs. Apr 28, 2024).  
–  The MD&A’s “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section immediately below that table explains the drivers: principally stronger top-line growth and favorable timing of cash receipts."
"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","Here’s the simple math behind the “tempered” growth question:

1. Overall Total Revenue (GAAP)  
   - Q1 2024: \$634.3 million  
   - Q1 2025: \$884.0 million  
   – Year-over-year growth = (884.0 – 634.3)/634.3 = +39%  
   – (See slide “Total revenue grew 39% Y/Y and 7% Q/Q to \$884 million.”)

2. Total Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts  
   – Appendix – “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” shows:  
     • Q1 2024: \$610.4 million  
     • Q1 2025: \$878.7 million  
   – Year-over-year growth = (878.7 – 610.4)/610.4 = +44%  
   – (See slide “Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts grew 44% Y/Y and 7% Q/Q.”)

3. Difference  
   – 44% (ex-strat-contracts) minus 39% (overall) = 5 percentage points  

In other words, when you strip out the strategic commercial contracts, Q1 2025 revenue actually grows 5 pp faster year-over-year (44% vs. 39%)."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Below is the summary of your three‐part request, with all amounts in millions and references to the Condensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of NVIDIA’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 27, 2025 (unaudited).

     • σ (popl) = √9 166 234 ≈ 3 027.7  

     ⇒ **Standard deviation ≃ $3 028 million**

2.   Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities as of Jan 26, 2025  
     From “Reported as Amortized Cost / Unrealized Gain / Unrealized Loss / Estimated Fair Value” (Note 5, page 10):  

     – Corporate debt securities unrealized gain = **$51 million**  

3.   % increase in Level 1 money market funds  
     From “Fair Value at Apr 27, 2025 and Jan 26, 2025 – Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities” (Note 6, page 12):  

     – Jan 26, 2025 Level 1 Money Market Funds = $3 760  
     – Apr 27, 2025 Level 1 Money Market Funds = $6 522  
     – Increase = 6 522 – 3 760 = 2 762  
     – % Increase = 2 762 / 3 760 × 100 ≈ **73.5%**  

Finally, management notes in Note 5 (page 11) that “Gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates.”"
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","**Answer Summary**  
After the Q4 2024 one-time SAR charge depressed both GAAP operating income and GAAP net income, the rebound (i.e. “acceleration”) in GAAP operating income from Q4 2024 → Q1 2025 outpaced the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income by **\$67.6 million**.

---

**1. GAAP Operating Income**  
(Source: “GAAP Operating Income” slide)  
- Q3 2024: \$113.1 M  
- Q4 2024: \$ 11.0 M  
- Q1 2025: \$176.0 M  

Sequential changes:  
- Q3→Q4 2024 = \$11.0 M − \$113.1 M = **−\$102.1 M** (the one-time SAR hit)  
- Q4 2024→Q1 2025 = \$176.0 M − \$ 11.0 M = **+ \$165.0 M**  

Acceleration in operating income =  
 (Q4→Q1 change) − (Q3→Q4 change)  
 = \$165.0 M − (−\$102.1 M)  
 = **\$267.1 M**  

---

**2. GAAP Net Income**  
(Source: “GAAP Net Income” slide)  
- Q3 2024: \$143.5 M  
- Q4 2024:  \$ 79.0 M  
- Q1 2025: \$214.0 M  

Sequential changes:  
- Q3→Q4 2024 = \$ 79.0 M − \$143.5 M = **−\$64.5 M**  
- Q4 2024→Q1 2025 = \$214.0 M − \$ 79.0 M = **+ \$135.0 M**  

Acceleration in net income =  
 (Q4→Q1 change) − (Q3→Q4 change)  
 = \$135.0 M − (−\$64.5 M)  
 = **\$199.5 M**  

---

**3. Difference in Accelerations**  
Operating-income acceleration (\$267.1 M) minus net-income acceleration (\$199.5 M) =  
**\$67.6 million**  

Thus, after the one-time SAR expense hit in Q4 2024, the “snap-back” improvement in GAAP operating income exceeded that in GAAP net income by \$67.6 million."

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","1. Fiscal-Year Lease-Obligation Data (Note 14 – Leases)

   “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of $ 7.4 billion primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  

   • The ~12.8% CAGR through FY 2028 reflects the front-loaded growth in scheduled operating obligations.  
   • Beyond FY 2028, additional lease starts (through FY 2030) will drive total undiscounted future commitments to approximately $2.1 billion (per the FY 2026–FY 2031 schedule) plus an expected $7.4 billion of new data center and office leases (undiscounted, over Q2 FY 2026–FY 2030).

"According to Nvidia’s cash flow statement, when it was incorrectly claimed that net cash used in investing activities exceeded share repurchases for the period, what were the actual figures for net cash used in investing activities versus share repurchases and how did dividends paid compare to payments for employee stock plan taxes?","Here’s what the April 27, 2025 cash‐flow table actually shows for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (three months ended Apr 27, 2025):

- Net cash used in investing activities: $ 5,216 million  
- Payments for repurchases of common stock (“share repurchases”): $ 14,095 million  
  → Investing outflow was **far below** financing outflow for buybacks, not above it.

- Dividends paid: $ 244 million  
- Payments related to employee stock-plan taxes: $ 1,532 million

"On a quarter-over-quarter basis, by how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s net working capital change, by how many millions of dollars did its retained earnings increase, and what percentage of that retained earnings increase was consumed by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets?","Here’s the quarter-to-quarter move, based on the April 27, 2025 vs. January 26, 2025 data:

1.   Net working capital change  
     –  Q2 FY 2026 current assets: $89,935 million  
     –  Q2 FY 2026 current liabilities: $26,542 million  
     –  Net working capital (4/27/25) = $89,935 – $26,542 = $63,393 million  
     –  Q1 FY 2026 current assets: $80,126 million  
     –  Q1 FY 2026 current liabilities: $18,047 million  
     –  Net working capital (1/26/25) = $80,126 – $18,047 = $62,079 million  
     –  Δ Net working capital = $63,393 – $62,079 = +$1,314 million  
     (Source: “Total current assets” and “Total current liabilities” on Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, p. 5.)

2.   Retained earnings increase  
     –  Retained earnings (4/27/25) = $72,158 million  
     –  Retained earnings (1/26/25) = $68,038 million  
     –  Δ Retained earnings = $72,158 – $68,038 = +$4,120 million  
     (Source: “Retained earnings” on Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, p. 5.)

3.   % of the retained-earnings rise consumed by PPE & intangibles purchases  
     –  Purchases of property & equipment and intangible assets = $1,227 million (investing activities)  
     –  1,227 / 4,120 ≈ 29.8%  
     (Source: “Purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets” on Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows, p. 7.)

Answer summary  
• Net working capital increased by $1,314 million  
• Retained earnings rose by $4,120 million  
• About 30% of that retained‐earnings increase was consumed by purchases of property & equipment and intangible assets"

"In Q1 FY26, following the USG’s April 9, 2025 export licensing requirements that diminished demand for H20 products, what percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales did NVIDIA’s related excess inventory charge represent, and by how many percentage points did that percentage exceed Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin?","In Q1 of fiscal 2026, the USG‐mandated export licence led NVIDIA to take a $4.5 billion excess‐inventory charge against H20 product sales of $4.6 billion.  
  - Charge as a percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales:  
    4.5 / 4.6 ≈ 97.8% (≈ 98%) [1]  
  - Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin: 44% [2]

"What is the full applicability date of the EU AI Act, what licensing requirement and compliance deadline would the US government's ""AI Diffusion"" IFR have imposed on NVIDIA's H200 and GB200 data center products, and which NVIDIA product category would the USG's ""Connected Vehicle"" import restrictions affect?","1. EU AI Act full applicability  
   - The Act “became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period”¹ – i.e. it is fully in force on August 1, 2026.

2. USG “AI Diffusion” IFR licensing & deadline  
   - It would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement (under ECCNs 3A090.a, 4A090.a or the corresponding “.z” entries) on all covered items – including NVIDIA’s H200 and GB200 data-center products and related software.  
   - That requirement would kick in after a 120-day delayed compliance period from the IFR’s January 15, 2025 publication (roughly by mid-May 2025).²

3. USG “Connected Vehicle” import restrictions  
   - These curbs target “the import and sale of certain automotive products” in the U.S.,³ i.e. NVIDIA’s automotive product category (its Automotive segment and vehicle-platform offerings).

"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","Here’s how the two ratios break down from the pieces you cite:

1. Net share of investors expecting further USD depreciation  
   – “Nearly 70% of investors… and a **net 61%**, the highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to depreciate.”¹  

2. Three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar  
   – U.S. assets have seen these “triple‐sell-off” days on roughly **7.5%** of trading days over the last three years.²  

  ⇒ Ratio #1 = 61% ÷ 7.5% ≃ **8.1**  

---

3. Volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio vs. a U.S. dollar‐domestic bond portfolio  
   – “A dollar-based investor in an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost **2×** the volatility of a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years.”³  

  ⇒ Ratio #2 ≃ **2**  

---

Comparison  
– Investor‐sentiment ratio (61/7.5) is about **8 times**, versus a **2×** volatility multiple.  
– In other words, the market’s net expectation of further dollar weakness relative to the incidence of U.S. triple‐sell-offs is roughly **four times larger** than the volatility differential between unhedged ex-U.S. and U.S. bond portfolios.
