"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and US revenue grew 39%, 44% and 55% year-over-year, respectively; the standard deviation of those growth rates was 6.68 percentage points; the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 to Q1 2025 was 3.50 percentage points; and these volatility measures align with the Company’s 83% Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025.","Here’s the requested analysis, step by step:

1. Year-over-year growth rates (Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024)  
   - Total revenue: +39%  
   - Total revenue ex strategic commercial contracts: +44%  
   - U.S. revenue: +55%  

2. Volatility across those three Y/Y growth rates  
   - Series: [39%, 44%, 55%]  
   - Mean = (39+44+55)/3 = 46.0%  
   - Population standard deviation  
     = √[ ((39−46)² + (44−46)² + (55−46)²) / 3 ]  
     = √[ (49 + 4 + 81) / 3 ]  
     = √(44.67) ≈ 6.7 percentage points  

3. Quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 (Q2 ’23 → Q1 ’25)  

   | Quarter | Ro40 | Δ pts vs. prior quarter |
   |---------|------|-------------------------|
   | Q2 2023 | 38%  | –                       |
   | Q3 2023 | 46%  | +8                      |
   | Q4 2023 | 54%  | +8                      |
   | Q1 2024 | 57%  | +3                      |
   | Q2 2024 | 64%  | +7                      |
   | Q3 2024 | 68%  | +4                      |
   | Q4 2024 | 81%  | +13                     |
   | Q1 2025 | 83%  | +2                      |

   - Δ-series = [ 8, 8, 3, 7, 4, 13, 2 ]  
   - Mean Δ ≈ 6.43 pts  
   - Population standard deviation  
     = √[Σ(Δ − 6.43)² / 7] ≈ 3.5 points  

4. Relation to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 = 83%  
   - The Rule of 40 has risen steadily from 38% in Q2 2023 to 83% in Q1 2025  
   - Its quarter-to-quarter volatility (~±3.5 pts stdev) is modest compared with the level shift  
   - Meanwhile, revenue-growth volatility (~±6.7 pts across the three Y/Y metrics) underscores that, even with some dispersion in growth rates, Palantir has driven both top-line acceleration (especially in the U.S.) and margin expansion to deliver a very robust 83% Rule of 40 in Q1 2025.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?",Palantir’s operating expense per US commercial customer decreased by 22.93% year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025.,"Below is a back‐of‐the‐envelope calculation of operating expense per U.S. commercial customer in Q1 2024 versus Q1 2025, and the year-over-year percent change.

1. Key inputs  
   • Revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts  
     – Q1 2024: \$610 million¹  
     – Q1 2025: \$879 million¹  
   • Adjusted operating income  
     – Q1 2024: \$226 million²  
     – Q1 2025: \$391 million³  
   • U.S. commercial customers (TTM ended Mar 31)  
     – Q1 2024: 262 customers⁴  
     – Q1 2025: 432 customers⁴  

2. Compute operating expenses  
   Operating expense ≈ (Revenue excl. strategic) – (Adj. operating income)  

   – Q1 2024: \$610M – \$226M = \$384M  
   – Q1 2025: \$879M – \$391M = \$488M  

3. Compute operating expense per customer  
   – Q1 2024: \$384 M ÷ 262 ≃ \$1.47 M/customer  
   – Q1 2025: \$488 M ÷ 432 ≃ \$1.13 M/customer  

4. Year-over-year change  
   %Δ = (1.13 – 1.47) ÷ 1.47 ≃ –0.23 ⇒ –23%  

Answer:  
Operating expense per U.S. commercial customer fell from about \$1.47 million in Q1 2024 to \$1.13 million in Q1 2025, a reduction of roughly 23% year-over-year.

1. GAAP operating income  
   - Q3 2024: \$113.1 M  
   - Q4 2024:   \$11.0 M  
   - Q1 2025: \$176.0 M

   → Q4→Q1 change = \$176.0 M − \$11.0 M = +\$165.0 M  

   Operating‐income acceleration =  
     (+\$165.0 M) − (−\$102.1 M)  
     = \$267.1 M  

2. GAAP net income  
   - Q3 2024: \$143.5 M  
   - Q4 2024:  \$79.0 M  
   - Q1 2025: \$214.0 M  

   → Q3→Q4 change = \$79.0 M − \$143.5 M = −\$64.5 M  
   → Q4→Q1 change = \$214.0 M − \$79.0 M = +\$135.0 M  

   Net‐income acceleration =  
     (+\$135.0 M) − (−\$64.5 M)  
     = \$199.5 M  

3. Difference in accelerations  
     \$267.1 M − \$199.5 M ≈ \$67.6 M

That implies a two-year compound annual growth rate of:

  
CAGR = (349/274)^(1/2) – 1 ≈ 12.8% p.a.

In other words, the roughly 13% annual increase in booked lease obligations through FY 2028 is the front‐end of a much larger $7.4 billion expansion of data‐center and office space that will be placed in service beginning in Q2 FY 2026 and tapering off in FY 2030.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)

Over the four quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) intervals in the TTM to Mar 31, 2025, US commercial customer growth (%) was  
13%, 9%, 19% and 13%, while total customer growth was 7%, 6%, 13% and 8%.  The population standard deviations of those two series are approximately:

- σ(US commercial QoQ) ≃ 3.6 percentage points  
- σ(total QoQ) ≃ 2.7 percentage points  

Their ratio is therefore about 3.6/2.7 ≃ **1.3**.

"Between the first quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2026, by how many basis points did NVIDIA’s operating lease cash flow conversion ratio—calculated as operating cash flow used for operating leases divided by operating lease expense—change?",NVIDIA’s operating lease cash flow conversion ratio increased by 880 basis points between the first quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2026.,"Between Q1 2025 and Q1 2026, NVIDIA’s operating‐lease cash‐flow conversion ratio rose from  
69 / 80 = 86.3%  
to  
96 / 101 = 95.0%

"According to Nvidia’s cash flow statement, when it was incorrectly claimed that net cash used in investing activities exceeded share repurchases for the period, what were the actual figures for net cash used in investing activities versus share repurchases and how did dividends paid compare to payments for employee stock plan taxes?","Net cash used in investing activities was $5,216 million, which was less than the $14,095 million spent on share repurchases, and dividends paid were $244 million compared to $1,532 million of payments for employee stock plan taxes.","Here’s what the face of the statement actually shows for the quarter ended April 27, 2025 (with the prior-year quarter in parentheses):

- Net cash used in investing activities: \$ 5,216 million ( \$ 5,693 million )  
- Payments for share repurchases: \$ 14,095 million ( \$ 7,740 million )

So, rather than investing cash use “exceeding” buybacks, repurchases were almost three times the investing outflow.

In the same quarter:

- Dividends paid: \$ 244 million ( \$ 98 million )  
- Payments related to employee stock plan taxes: \$ 1,532 million ( \$ 1,752 million )

"On a quarter-over-quarter basis, by how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s net working capital change, by how many millions of dollars did its retained earnings increase, and what percentage of that retained earnings increase was consumed by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets?","NVIDIA’s net working capital increased by $1,314 million, retained earnings increased by $4,120 million, and purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets consumed 29.8% of that retained earnings increase.","**Answer:**  
• Net working capital increased by \$1,314 million (from \$62,079 million at Jan 26, 2025 to \$63,393 million at Apr 27, 2025).  
• Retained earnings rose by \$4,120 million (from \$68,038 million to \$72,158 million).  
• Purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets of \$1,227 million consumed approximately 29.8 % of that retained-earnings increase.  

**Calculations:**  
1. Net working capital = Current assets – Current liabilities  
   – Jan 26, 2025: \$80,126 m – \$18,047 m = \$62,079 m  
   – Apr 27, 2025: \$89,935 m – \$26,542 m = \$63,393 m  
   – Change: \$63,393 m – \$62,079 m = **\$1,314 million**  

2. Retained earnings change  
   – Jan 26, 2025: \$68,038 m → Apr 27, 2025: \$72,158 m  
   – Change: \$72,158 m – \$68,038 m = **\$4,120 million**  

3. % of retained-earnings increase used for capex and intangibles  
   – Purchases of property & equipment and intangible assets: \$1,227 m
