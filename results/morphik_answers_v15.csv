## 1. Year-Over-Year Growth Rates (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)

| Metric                                           | Q1 2024        | Q1 2025        | Growth (%)               | Source                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Total Revenue                                    | \$634 M        | \$884 M        | (884 – 634)/634 ≈ 39.4% → 39% | “Total revenue grew…to \$884 million” slide¹  |
| Total Revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts| \$610 M        | \$879 M        | (879 – 610)/610 ≈ 44.0%  → 44% | Appendix: “Revenue Excluding…” table²      |
| US Revenue                                       | \$406 M        | \$628 M        | (628 – 406)/406 ≈ 54.7%  → 55% | “US revenue grew…to \$628 million” slide³  |

## 2. Volatility of These Growth Rates

We treat the three Y/Y rates as a **population** and compute the standard deviation:

1. Compute the mean  
   μ = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46.0%

2. Compute squared deviations  
   (39 – 46)² = 49  
   (44 – 46)² = 4  
   (55 – 46)² = 81  

3. Population variance  
   σ² = (49 + 4 + 81) / 3 = 44.667

4. Population standard deviation  
   σ = √44.667 ≈ **6.7 percentage points**

> Standard deviation of the three Y/Y growth rates ≈ **6.7%**

## 3. Quarter-Over-Quarter Changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 2023 → Q1 2025)

| Quarter    | Rule of 40 (%) | QoQ Δ (%)      |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Q2 2023    | 38             | —              |
| Q3 2023    | 46             | +8             |

### Standard Deviation of QoQ Δ

Treating the seven QoQ changes [8, 8, 3, 7, 4, 13, 2] as a population:

1. Mean Δ  
   μ = (8 + 8 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 13 + 2)/7 ≈ 6.43%

2. Squared deviations  
   (8–6.43)²≈2.47, (8–6.43)²≈2.47, (3–6.43)²≈11.76, (7–6.43)²≈0.33,  
   (4–6.43)²≈5.90, (13–6.43)²≈43.17, (2–6.43)²≈19.61  

3. Population variance  
   σ² = Sum / 7 ≈ 85.71 / 7 ≈ 12.24  

4. Population standard deviation  
   σ = √12.24 ≈ **3.5 percentage points**

> Std. dev. of Rule of 40 QoQ changes ≈ **3.5%**

## 4. Relating Volatility to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 (83%)

- **Rule of 40 = Growth (39%) + Adjusted Op. Margin (44%) = 83%**  
  (Slide “Rule of 40” for Q1 2025)

- The **moderate SD of Y/Y revenue growth (≈6.7%)** versus the **lower SD of QoQ Rule of 40 changes (≈3.5%)** shows:
  - Revenue growth, while robust (39–55% range), exhibits more dispersion across definitions (total vs. ex-SCC vs. US).
  - The Rule of 40 has tightened its quarter-to-quarter variation, reflecting steadily improving operating leverage and margin.

- By Q1 2025 the company achieves a **record-high 83% Rule of 40**, underpinned by:
  - **Strong revenue acceleration** (especially in the US: +55% Y/Y), and  
  - **High adjusted operating margin** (44% in Q1 2025).

Together, these volatility metrics underscore that Palantir’s growth and profitability have not only trended upward but have grown increasingly stable—culminating in the highest Rule of 40 score to date."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Here’s how we get to the ~23 % drop in operating expense per U.S. commercial customer from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025:

1. Pull the underlying numbers  
  - Revenue Excl Strat Commercial Contracts (Appendix, “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” table)  
    • Q1 2024 = $610,440 K  
    • Q1 2025 = $878,708 K  
  - Adjusted Operating Income (Appendix, “Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income…” table)  
    • Q1 2024 = $226,458 K  
    • Q1 2025 = $390,710 K  
  - U.S. Commercial Customer Count (slide “US Commercial Customer Count”)  
    • TTM ended Mar 31, 2024 = 262 customers  
    • TTM ended Mar 31, 2025 = 432 customers  

2. Compute Operating Expense  
   Operating Expense ≈ (Revenue Excl Strat Comm Contracts) – (Adjusted Op Income)  
   – Q1 2024:  
     610,440 – 226,458 = 383,982 K  
   – Q1 2025:  
     878,708 – 390,710 = 487,998 K  

3. Divide by customer count to get per-customer load  
   Op Exp per customer = Operating Expense ÷ U.S. Commercial Customers  
   – Q1 2024:  
     383,982 K ÷ 262 ≈ 1,465 K per customer  
   – Q1 2025:  
     487,998 K ÷ 432 ≈ 1,130 K per customer  

4. Year-over-year change  
   % Change = (1,130 – 1,465) ÷ 1,465 ≈ –0.229  ⇒  –22.9 %  

**Conclusion**  
Operating expense per U.S. commercial customer fell from about \$1.465 million in Q1 2024 to \$1.130 million in Q1 2025, a year-over-year decrease of roughly **23 %**."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","Here are the three pieces, with sources and workings:

1. Change in Total “Other Assets”  
• As of January 26, 2025: Total other assets = \$6,425 million  
• As of April 27, 2025: Total other assets = \$6,788 million  
• Change = \$6,788 – \$6,425 = **\$363 million increase**  
  (See “Other Assets (Long Term)” table, Note on pages showing Other Assets—Total other assets)  

2. Increase in Assumed-Liability Acquisitions  
• Q1 FY 2026 assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment & intangible assets = \$408 million  
• Q1 FY 2025 assumed-liability acquisitions = \$147 million  
• Increase = \$408 – \$147 = **\$261 million**  
  (See “Property and Equipment” note: “…acquired by assuming related liabilities…\$408 million and \$147 million…”)  

3. % of Q1 FY 2026 Acquisitions Represented by Intangible-Asset Amortization  
• Q1 FY 2026 intangible-asset amortization expense = \$159 million  
  (Note 7: “Amortization expense … was \$159 million and \$143 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025…”)  
• % = \$159 / \$408 ≈ 0.3897 = **38.9%** (≈39%)  

Summary:  
- Total other assets rose by \$363 million between 1/26/25 and 4/27/25.  
- Assumed-liability acquisitions jumped by \$261 million year-over-year (Q1 FY 26 vs. Q1 FY 25).  
- The first‐quarter amortization of \$159 million was about 39% of the \$408 million of assumed-liability acquisitions in Q1 FY 2026."
"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","Below is the math and context behind the comparison:

1. Fair value of the CoreWeave investment as of April 27, 2025  
   – Per Note 5 (see footnote 1), NVIDIA reclassified its CoreWeave holding to marketable equity.  “The fair value of the investment as of April 27, 2025 was $1 billion…”  

2. Carrying‐value reclassification adjustment in Q1 FY26  
   – From Note 6, “Adjustments related to non-marketable equity securities… Reclassification (1) … $(843) million.”  

3. Excess of CoreWeave fair value over the reclassification adjustment  
   – $1,000 million – $843 million = $157 million  

—  
Market Performance & Comparative Analysis  
• Publicly-held equity securities (Level 1) rose from $381 million at Jan 26, 2025 to $1,251 million at Apr 27, 2025, largely driven by CoreWeave’s market debut and broader tech market strength.  
• In Q1 FY26 non-marketable equity securities’ closing balance was $3,240 million (versus $1,463 million a year earlier), but included an $843 million reclassification as CoreWeave moved on-exchange.  
• The $157 million spread underscores the premium investors placed on CoreWeave’s liquidity versus its prior private‐valuation basis.  

Forecast & Outlook  
• Management notes in MD&A (page 24) that AI-and-cloud GPU demand remains strong, which should support further valuation upside for CoreWeave once short‐term sale restrictions lapse.  
• Volatility may persist—NVIDIA will continue quarterly fair-value reviews and could record impairments or additional reclassifications if market conditions deteriorate.  
• Longer term, growth in generative AI workloads and expansion of DGX Cloud offerings underpin consensus forecasts for continued appreciation in NVIDIA’s publicly-traded minority investments."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Below is the answer “as if” the 83% Rule-of-40 score had been computed by adding Q1 2025 adjusted free cash flow margin to the U.S. Government revenue Q/Q growth rate.

"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","Here’s how NVIDIA actually reported the change in net cash provided by operating activities for Q1 FY 2026 versus Q1 FY 2025:

1.  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Three Months Ended)  
    •  Q1 FY 2026 (ended Apr 27, 2025):  
       Net cash provided by operating activities = \$27,414 million  
    •  Q1 FY 2025 (ended Apr 28, 2024):  
       Net cash provided by operating activities = \$15,345 million  

2.  Year-over-Year Dollar Change  
    Δ = \$27,414 M – \$15,345 M = **\$12,069 million increase**  

3.  Drivers of the Change (Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion)  
    NVIDIA discloses in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” (10-Q, p. 28):  
      “Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, **due to higher revenue and timing of cash collections**.”

"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","The “total-revenue ex-strategic commercial contracts” line grew 44% year-over-year in Q1 2025, versus a 39% year-over-year increase in unconsolidated total revenue.  That is a spread of 5 percentage points ( 44% − 39% = 5% ).  

Calculation detail (all figures in thousands, per the Q1 2025 Appendix):  
- Revenue ex-strategic commercial contracts:  
  • Q1 2024: \$610,440  
  • Q1 2025: \$878,708  
  → \[(878,708 − 610,440) / 610,440\] × 100 ≃ 44%  
  
- Total revenue:  
  • Q1 2024: \$634,338  
  • Q1 2025: \$883,855  
  → \[(883,855 − 634,338) / 634,338\] × 100 ≃ 39%

"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Below is a brief summary of the three items, together with the calculation approach and the specific note/table references.  

**1. Standard deviation of the Q-over-Q changes in estimated fair value by maturity**  
From the “contractual maturity” table for debt securities included in cash equivalents & marketable securities (Note 5, pg. 11), we have:

| Maturity        | Jan 26, 2025 Fair Value | Apr 27, 2025 Fair Value | Change (Δ)     |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| < 1 year        | \$18,450 million        | \$25,781 million        | + \$7,331 million |
| 1–5 years       |   23,656                 |   26,355                 | + 2,699         |
| Total           |   42,106                 |   52,136                 | + 10,030        |

Calculation (population standard deviation):

1. Compute the mean Δ:  
   μ = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030) / 3 = 6,686.67  
2. Compute squared deviations and average them:  

   σ² = [ (7,331–6,686.67)² + (2,699–6,686.67)² + (10,030–6,686.67)² ] / 3  
      = (644.33² + (–3,987.67)² + 3,343.33²) / 3  
      ≈ (415,190 + 15,901,430 + 11,180,010) / 3  
      ≈ 9,165,543  

3. σ = √9,165,543 ≈ **\$3,028 million**  

**2. Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities as of Jan 26, 2025**  
From the summary of marketable securities (Note 5, pg. 10):  

- Corporate debt securities – Amortized cost \$18,504 million;  
  Unrealized gain **\$51 million**; Unrealized loss \$29 million;  
  Estimated fair value \$18,526 million.  

**3. % increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value**  
From the Level 1 fair-value table (Note 6, pg. 12):  

- Money market funds  
  – Jan 26, 2025: \$3,760 million  
  – Apr 27, 2025: \$6,522 million  

Δ = 6,522 – 3,760 = \$2,762 million  
% increase = (2,762 / 3,760) × 100 ≈ **73.4%**

  • Q3 2024: \$113.1 M  
  • Q4 2024:  \$ 11.0 M  
  • Q1 2025: \$176.0 M

### 2. GAAP Net Income “Acceleration”

From the GAAP Net Income trend (slide titled “GAAP Net Income”):

  • Q3 2024: \$143.5 M  
  • Q4 2024:  \$ 79.0 M  
  • Q1 2025: \$214.0 M

### 3. Difference in Accelerations

Difference = Operating-income acceleration − Net-income acceleration  
= \$267.1 M − \$199.5 M  
= **\$67.6 M**

Thus, after the one-time SAR expense in Q4 2024, the swing in GAAP operating income exceeded the analogous net-income swing by \$67.6 million."

     • Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$4,310 million  
     • Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$19,211 million  
     ⇒ 4,310 / 19,211 = 0.2244 → 22.4%

"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?","Between the trailing-twelve-months (“TTM”) ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, Palantir’s:

- Global commercial customer count rose from 427 to 622, an increase of  
  622 – 427 = 195 customers.  
  (See “Commercial Customer Count” slide, TTM Mar 31 2024 vs. TTM Mar 31 2025.)

- U.S. commercial customer count rose from 262 to 432, an increase of

  (See “US Commercial Customer Count” slide, TTM Mar 31 2024 vs. TTM Mar 31 2025.)

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","**Answer:**  

1.  **Calculation of CAGR of operating lease obligations (FY 2026 → FY 2028)**  
   From NVIDIA’s Note 14 (Future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable operating leases):  
   - FY 2026 (excluding Q1): \$ 274 million  
   - FY 2027: \$ 346 million  
   - FY 2028: \$ 349 million  
     
   We compute the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over two years (FY 2026 → FY 2028) as:  

   > CAGR = (Ending Value ÷ Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Periods) – 1  
   >
   > = (349 ÷ 274)^(1/2) – 1  
   > ≈ (1.2737)^(0.5) – 1  
   > ≈ 1.1285 – 1  
   > ≈ 0.1285, or **12.9% per annum**  

   (All figures in millions; see Note 14, p. 21.)  

2.  **Relation to NVIDIA’s lease-commencement expectations**  
   In the same note, NVIDIA discloses its forward-looking lease commitments:  

   > “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of \$7.4 billion primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  

   (Note 14, p. 21.)  

   – By comparison to the \$274–\$349 million per year of existing lease obligations in FY 2026–28, the planned \$7.4 billion of new commitments over roughly 4½ fiscal years implies a much steeper growth trajectory going forward.  
   – If recognized evenly, \$7.4 billion over FY Q2 2026–FY 2030 averages to ~\$1.6 billion per year—almost five times the \$0.3–0.35 billion annual levels historically recorded.  
   – Thus, while NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations grew at a ~13% CAGR through FY 2028, the company’s strategic expansion of data-center and office space underlies expectations for a materially higher growth rate in lease obligations in coming years."
"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","Below is an analysis of the quarter-over-quarter (Q/Q) growth-rate volatility for U.S. commercial customers versus total customers over the four quarters ending March 31, 2025.  We then compare that relative volatility to management’s headline “+65% Y/Y U.S. commercial customer count” growth.

---

### 1. Extracting the Q/Q growth rates  
From the “US Commercial Customer Count” chart (TTM ended Mar 31 2024 → Jun 30 2024 → Sep 30 2024 → Dec 31 2024 → Mar 31 2025) and the parallel “Customer Count” chart:

| Period                      | US Commercial Count | Q/Q Growth  | Total Customer Count | Q/Q Growth |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------:|----------------------|-----------:|
| TTM ended Mar 31 2024       | 262                 |        —    | 554                  |    —       |
| TTM ended Jun 30 2024       | 295                 | +13.0%      | 593                  | +7.0%      |
| TTM ended Sep 30 2024       | 321                 | +8.8%       | 629                  | +6.1%      |
| TTM ended Dec 31 2024       | 382                 | +19.0%      | 711                  | +13.0%     |
| TTM ended Mar 31 2025       | 432                 | +13.1%      | 769                  | +8.2%      |

> Sources:  
> • “US Commercial Customer Count” (Q1 Financials slide)  
> • “Customer Count” (Q1 Financials slide)

We convert those to decimal form for volatility calculations:

- US Commercial Q/Q rates: [0.13, 0.088, 0.19, 0.131]  
- Total Customer Q/Q rates: [0.07, 0.061, 0.13, 0.082]

### 2. Computing standard deviations  
Treating each four-quarter sequence as a population:

1. Compute the mean of each series  
2. Compute the variance as the average squared deviation  
3. Take the square root → standard deviation (σ)

**US Commercial**  
- Mean μ₁ = (0.13 + 0.088 + 0.19 + 0.131) / 4 = 0.135  
- Variance σ₁² = [(0.13–0.135)² + (0.088–0.135)² + (0.19–0.135)² + (0.131–0.135)²] / 4  
                 ≈ (0.000025 + 0.002209 + 0.003025 + 0.000016) / 4  
                 = 0.005275 / 4 ≈ 0.001319  
- σ₁ ≈ √0.001319 = 0.0363 (or 3.6%)

**Total Customers**  
- Mean μ₂ = (0.07 + 0.061 + 0.13 + 0.082) / 4 = 0.086  
- Variance σ₂² = [(0.07–0.086)² + (0.061–0.086)² + (0.13–0.086)² + (0.082–0.086)²] / 4  
                 ≈ (0.000256 + 0.000625 + 0.001936 + 0.000016) / 4  
                 = 0.002833 / 4 ≈ 0.000708  
- σ₂ ≈ √0.000708 = 0.0266 (or 2.7%)

---

### 3. Volatility ratio  
Ratio = σ₁ / σ₂  
       ≈ 0.0363 / 0.0266  
       ≈ **1.36**

In other words, quarter-to-quarter growth in U.S. commercial customer count was roughly **36% more volatile** than growth in total customer count over the trailing twelve months ended March 31 2025.

---

### 4. Interpretation relative to 65% Y/Y growth  
Management highlights a **+65% year-over-year** increase in U.S. commercial customer count (Q1 Business Update slide).  The fact that the Q/Q standard deviation for U.S. commercial adds is ~1.36× that of the total base implies:

- **Stronger swings** from one quarter to the next in the U.S. commercial segment versus the overall book of customers  
- While the **65% Y/Y** headline underscores sustained growth, the **1.36 volatility ratio** suggests that the build-out has been **more “lumpy”**, with some quarters significantly above or below the average trend line

   • Add back Cost‐of‐Revenue stock-based compensation: $ 15,016 thousand  
   → Adjusted Gross Profit = $710,885 + $15,016 = $725,901 thousand

    • Jan 26, 2025:  $(37) million  
    • Apr 27, 2025:  $(36) million

    • As of Apr 27, 2025:  
       (36 ÷ 8,500) × 100 = 0.4235 %  

4.  Change over period  
    • Absolute change in cost:  $36 M − $37 M = − $1 M (i.e. the unamortized balance declined by $1 million)  
    • Percentage‐point change:  0.4235 % − 0.4353 % = − 0.0118 ppt (approx. − 1.2 basis points)

"In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, what was NVIDIA's interest coverage ratio (interest income divided by interest expense) and what percentage of its net interest spread did net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities—driven by fair value volatility in investments including CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.—consume?","**Answer:**

- **Interest coverage ratio**  
  For the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (three months ended April 27, 2025) NVIDIA reported interest income of \$515 million and interest expense of \$63 million.  Its interest coverage ratio (interest income ÷ interest expense) was therefore:

  \[ 515 ÷ 63 ≈ 8.2 times \]

- **Consumption of net interest spread by net unrealized losses**  
  NVIDIA’s net interest spread (interest income minus interest expense) was:

  \[ 515 – 63 = \$452 million \]

  Net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities in that quarter totaled \$222 million (driven by fair-value swings in investments such as CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.).  As a percentage of the \$452 million spread, those losses consumed:

…you get roughly an 8:1 ratio.

By contrast, on the volatility side:

> “A dollar-based investor in an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 2× the volatility of a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years.”³

So:

-  The investor‐sentiment ratio is about 8:1  
-  The bond‐portfolio volatility multiple is about 2:1  

In other words, the market’s skew toward expecting more dollar weakness has been roughly four times as large (8×) as the extra volatility you actually get from an unhedged ex-U.S. bond allocation (2×).
