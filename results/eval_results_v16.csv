"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and US revenue grew 39%, 44% and 55% year-over-year, respectively; the standard deviation of those growth rates was 6.68 percentage points; the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 to Q1 2025 was 3.50 percentage points; and these volatility measures align with the Company’s 83% Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025.","Below is a step-by-step walk-through of the requested figures, how they were calculated, and where you can find them in the deck:

1.  Year-over-year revenue growth rates  
   •  Total revenue  
      –  Q1 2024: \$634 M → Q1 2025: \$884 M (from slide “Total Revenue Growth,” Q1 Financials)  
      –  Growth % = (884 – 634)/634 ≈ 39.4% ⇒ **39% Y/Y** (rounded per slide)  
   •  Total revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts  
      –  Q1 2024: \$610.4 M → Q1 2025: \$878.7 M (from appendix table “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts”)  
      –  Growth % = (878.7 – 610.4)/610.4 ≈ 44.0% ⇒ **44% Y/Y**  
   •  U.S. revenue  
      –  Q1 2024: \$406 M → Q1 2025: \$628 M (from slide “US Revenue Growth,” Q1 Financials)  
      –  Growth % = (628 – 406)/406 ≈ 54.7% ⇒ **55% Y/Y**  

2.  Dispersion of those three Y/Y growth rates  
   We have the three numbers: {39%, 44%, 55%}.  
   •  Mean = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46.0%  
   •  Population standard deviation  
      σ = √[Σ(xi – μ)² / 3]  
        = √[(–7)² + (–2)² + (+9)²  ÷ 3]  
        = √[49 + 4 + 81 ÷ 3]  
        = √[44.67]  
        ≈ **6.7 pp**  
   •  Sample standard deviation (n–1)  
      s = √[Σ(xi – μ)² / (3–1)] = √[134/2] ≈ **8.2 pp**  

3.  Quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 (Q2 ’23 → Q1 ’25)  
   From slide “Reconciliation of Rule of 40” (appendix):  
     Q2 ’23 38%, Q3 ’23 46%, Q4 ’23 54%, Q1 ’24 57%, Q2 ’24 64%, Q3 ’24 68%, Q4 ’24 81%, Q1 ’25 83%.  
   → Quarter-over-quarter deltas: {+8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2}.  
   •  Mean Δ = (8+8+3+7+4+13+2)/7 = 6.43 pp  
   •  Population σΔ = √[Σ(Δi – 6.43)²/7] ≈ √[12.24] ≈ **3.5 pp**  
   •  Sample sΔ = √[Σ(Δi – 6.43)²/6] ≈ √[14.29] ≈ **3.8 pp**  

4.  Connecting volatility to Q1 2025’s Rule of 40 of 83%  
   –  The three Y/Y revenue-growth metrics display a dispersion (σ) of roughly **6.7–8.2 percentage points**, reflecting that segment growth rates range from ~39% to 55%.  
   –  By contrast, the Rule of 40’s quarter-to-quarter improvements have been remarkably steady, with a σΔ of only **3.5–3.8 pp**, underscoring consistent operating-leverage gains.  
   –  Q1 2025’s **83% Rule of 40** (from the same appendix slide) sits near the top of that steadily-rising series—well above the 40% “hurdle” line—and reflects both the acceleration in revenue and expanded adjusted operating margin in the U.S. and globally.

"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?",Palantir’s operating expense per US commercial customer decreased by 22.93% year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025.,"Here’s how we get to the ~23% year-over-year decline in operating expense per U.S. commercial customer between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025:

1.  Pull the relevant numbers:  
    - From the Appendix slide “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts”¹:  
      • Q1 2024 revenue excl. strat. commercial: \$634,338 K – \$23,898 K = **\$610,440 K**  
      • Q1 2025 revenue excl. strat. commercial: \$883,855 K – \$ 5,147 K = **\$878,708 K**  
    - From the slide “We continue to invest aggressively in AIP …”²:  
      • Q1 2024 adjusted operating income: **\$226 M**  
      • Q1 2025 adjusted operating income: **\$391 M**  
    - From the slide “US Commercial Customer Count”³:  
      • TTM ended Mar 31 2024: **262 customers**  
      • TTM ended Mar 31 2025: **432 customers**

2.  Compute implied operating expense (= revenue excl. strat – adjusted op. income):  
    - Q1 2024: \$610.44 M – \$226 M = **\$384.44 M**  
    - Q1 2025: \$878.71 M – \$391 M = **\$487.71 M**

3.  Divide by U.S. commercial customer count to get expense per customer:  
    - Q1 2024: \$384.44 M / 262 ≈ **\$1.47 M/customer**  
    - Q1 2025: \$487.71 M / 432 ≈ **\$1.13 M/customer**

4.  Calculate the % change:  
    ( \$1.13 M – \$1.47 M ) / \$1.47 M ≈ **–22.9%** (i.e. ~23% decrease)

"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","The fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceeded the Q1 FY26 non-marketable equity securities reclassification adjustment by $157 million.","Here’s the reconciliation of the two key amounts (all figures in millions):  

1. Fair value of the CoreWeave investment as of April 27, 2025  
   - From Note 5, “Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities” footnote (1):  
     “The fair value of the investment as of April 27, 2025 was \$1 billion…”

Difference = \$1,000 million – \$843 million = **\$157 million**  

—  

  

 Market Performance Context  
 • CoreWeave’s shares began trading publicly in Q1 FY26, driving its reclassification from “non-marketable” to “marketable.”  
 • A \$1 billion fair-value stamp at quarter-end implies strong investor appetite for data-center‐focused, AI-accelerated infrastructure plays.  

 Comparative Analysis  
 • The \$843 million write-out against long-term “other assets” reflects the carrying value of CoreWeave on NVIDIA’s books immediately before public trading.  
 • The \$157 million positive gap (1,000 − 843) represents the lift in mark-to-market valuation above the prior estimate.  

 Outlook / Forecasts  
 • As CoreWeave scales its DGX-based cloud services and grows its NVLink-connected GPU farms, NVIDIA management has indicated further valuation gains may be realized.  
 • NVIDIA’s continued customer commitments (e.g., multi-year cloud service agreements totaling \$10.6 billion as of April 27, 2025) provide upside support for hosted-infrastructure investments like CoreWeave.  
 • Should AI-driven compute demand stay on its current trajectory, future revaluations of this equity stake could exceed today’s \$1 billion mark, potentially widening the fair-value premium over the legacy carrying amount.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)

1.  Cash‐flow adjustments  
    • Stock-based compensation expense (CFS, p. 7)  
       – Q1 ’26: $ 1,474 M  
       – Q1 ’25: $ 1,011 M  
    • Depreciation & amortization (CFS, p. 7)  
       – Q1 ’26: $  611 M

    ————————————————————————  
    Combined (CFS):  
      Q1 ’26 = $ 1,474 + 611 = 2,085 M  
      Q1 ’25 = $ 1,011 + 410 = 1,421 M  
    Growth = (2,085 – 1,421)/1,421 = 0.4673 ≈ 46.7%

"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?",Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts outpaced overall total revenue growth by 5 percentage points year-over-year in Q1 2025.,"The impact of excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts (SCC) can be seen in the two Q1 2025 growth rates:

1.   Total revenue, as reported on the “Total revenue grew 39% Y/Y…” slide (and in the Rule of 40 appendix), rose from \$634 million in Q1 2024 to \$884 million in Q1 2025, a 39% year-over-year increase.  
     Calculation:  
     \(\displaystyle (884–634)/634\times100\approx39\%\).

2.   Revenue excluding SCC, on the “Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts grew 44% Y/Y…” slide (and in the Appendix table), rose from \$610 million in Q1 2024 to \$879 million in Q1 2025, a 44% year-over-year increase.  
     Calculation (from Appendix):  
     Q1 2024 ex-SCC = \$610,440 K; Q1 2025 ex-SCC = \$878,708 K  
     \(\displaystyle (878{,}708–610{,}440)/610{,}440\times100\approx44\%\).

Subtracting the two Y/Y rates:  
44% – 39% = 5 percentage points.

Acceleration = (+\$135.0 M) − (–\$64.5 M) = **+\$199.5 M**  

### 3. Excess of Operating-Income Acceleration over Net-Income Acceleration

\[
\$267.1\text{ M} \;-\; \$199.5\text{ M}

**1. Change in Excess Inventory Purchase Obligations as a % of Total Accrued and Other Current Liabilities**  
From Note 8 (“Balance Sheet Components”) we have:

  Accrued and Other Current Liabilities (in $ millions)  
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────  
  line item                       │ Apr 27, 2025 │ Jan 26, 2025

  Total accrued & other current liab.  │ 19,211     │ 11,737  
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────  

Compute each period’s ratio:

  • Apr 27, 2025:  
    4,310 / 19,211 = 0.2244 → 22.44%  
  • Jan 26, 2025:  
    2,095 / 11,737 = 0.1785 → 17.85%  

Difference (change in percentage points):

  22.44% – 17.85% = 4.59 percentage points

**2. Outstanding Inventory Purchase & Long-Term Supply/Capacity Obligations as a % of Net Long-Term Debt**  
From Note 11 (“Commitments and Contingencies”):

  “As of April 27, 2025, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling $29.8 billion.”  

From Note 10 (“Debt”):

  Net long-term carrying amount of debt as of April 27, 2025 = $ 8,464 million (i.e. $ 8.464 billion).  

Compute the ratio:

  29.8 billion / 8.464 billion = 3.52 → 352%  

**Interpretation:**  
As of April 27, 2025, NVIDIA’s non-cancelable inventory-purchase and long-term supply/capacity commitments were approximately 3.5 times its net long-term debt, or about 352%.

"For NVIDIA’s quarter ended April 27, 2025, what percentage of its remaining performance obligations for contracts greater than one year was unbilled, and for Palantir in Q1 2025, what percentage of its total remaining performance obligations was classified as long-term under its ASC 606 election?",8.9% of NVIDIA’s greater-than-one-year RPO was unbilled and 52.6% of Palantir’s total Q1 2025 RPO was classified as long-term.,"**Answer:**

1) **NVIDIA (Quarter ended April 27, 2025)**  
   – In Note 2 (Deferred Revenue) to NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Form 10-Q, page 15), NVIDIA discloses:  
     • “Revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in length was $1.8 billion, which includes $1.6 billion from deferred revenue and $160 million which has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue.”  
   – Percentage unbilled = unbilled portion ÷ total remaining performance obligations  
         = $160 million ÷ $1,800 million  
         ≈ 8.9%  
   – Thus, approximately **9%** of RPO for contracts >1 year was unbilled.  

2) **Palantir (Q1 2025)**  
   – In Palantir’s “Additional Metrics and Notes” (Appendix slide “Remaining Performance Obligations”), the company breaks out total, short-term and long-term RPO as of Q1 2025:  
     • Total RPO: $1.90 billion  
     • Short-term RPO: $0.90 billion  
     • Long-term RPO: $1.00 billion  
   – Percentage classified as long-term = long-term RPO ÷ total RPO  
         = $1.00 billion ÷ $1.90 billion  
         ≈ 52.6%  
   – Therefore, **52.6%** of Palantir’s total RPO was classified as long-term under its ASC 606 practical-expedient election.

## 2. Calculating the 2026–2028 CAGR  

We measure the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over two full years (from the end of FY 2026 to the end of FY 2028):

\[
\text{CAGR} 
= \Bigl(\frac{\text{Lease}_{2028}}{\text{Lease}_{2026}}\Bigr)^{\tfrac{1}{2}} \;-\; 1
= \Bigl(\frac{349}{274}\Bigr)^{0.5} - 1
\approx 1.1286 - 1
\approx 0.1286
\;\Longrightarrow\; 12.9\%\text{ p.a.}
\]

- Beginning value (FY 2026): \$274 million  
- Ending value (FY 2028):   \$349 million  
- Periods: 2 years  
- Result: **≈ 12.9%** annual growth

## 3. Relating Historical Growth to Forward-Looking Commitments  

Immediately following the lease-obligations schedule, NVIDIA discloses:

> “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of **\$7.4 billion**, primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  
> (Note 14—Leases, p. 21)

Putting the two disclosures side by side:

- To date, minimum lease obligations have grown at a **~12.9%** CAGR from FY 2026 (\$274 M) to FY 2028 (\$349 M).
- **Looking forward**, management plans to kick off **\$7.4 billion** of additional data-center and office operating leases between Q2 FY 2026 and FY 2030—an amount more than triple the existing undiscounted \$2.1 billion shown in the FY 2026–2031 schedule.

**In other words**, the ~13% historical growth in lease commitments underpins a much larger pipeline of new lease obligations (\$7.4 billion) that NVIDIA expects to add over the next four-plus years, reflecting the company’s aggressive expansion of data center and office capacity.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)
"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","The ratio of the standard deviations is 1.33, indicating that US commercial customer count quarter-over-quarter growth was 1.33 times more volatile than total customer count growth, suggesting that despite management’s reported 65% year-over-year expansion the segment’s quarterly performance exhibited greater variability.","Below is the step-by-step calculation of the two series’ quarter-over-quarter (Q/Q) growth rates over the four quarters ending March 31, 2025, their standard deviations, and the ratio of those standard deviations:

1. Extract the TTM customer counts (from the “US Commercial Customer Count” and “Customer Count” slides under Q1 Financials):

   US Commercial Customers (TTM)  
   • Mar 31 2024: 262  
   • Jun 30 2024: 295  
   • Sep 30 2024: 321  
   • Dec 31 2024: 382  
   • Mar 31 2025: 432  
   (Management call-out: +65% Y/Y to 432 in TTM ended Mar 31 2025)

   Total Customers (TTM)  
   • Mar 31 2024: 554  
   • Jun 30 2024: 593  
   • Sep 30 2024: 629  
   • Dec 31 2024: 711  
   • Mar 31 2025: 769  

2. Compute Q/Q growth rates for each series:

   US Commercial Q/Q Growth (%)  
   • Q2 2024 vs Q1 2024: (295–262)/262 = +12.6% → 13% (rounded)  
   • Q3 2024 vs Q2 2024: (321–295)/295 = +8.8%   → 9%  
   • Q4 2024 vs Q3 2024: (382–321)/321 = +19.0%  → 19%  
   • Q1 2025 vs Q4 2024: (432–382)/382 = +13.1%  → 13%  

   Total Customers Q/Q Growth (%)  
   • Q2 2024 vs Q1 2024: (593–554)/554 = +7.0%   → 7%  
   • Q3 2024 vs Q2 2024: (629–593)/593 = +6.0%   → 6%  
   • Q4 2024 vs Q3 2024: (711–629)/629 = +13.0% → 13%  
   • Q1 2025 vs Q4 2024: (769–711)/711 = +8.1%   → 8%  

3. Calculate the population standard deviation of each four-quarter growth series:

   Formula (population σ):  
   σ = sqrt[ (1/N) Σ (growthᵢ – mean)² ]

   US Commercial Growth (%): [13, 9, 19, 13]  
   • Mean = (13+9+19+13)/4 = 13.5%  
   • Variance = [(–0.5)² + (–4.5)² + (5.5)² + (–0.5)²]/4  
               = (0.25 + 20.25 + 30.25 + 0.25)/4  
               = 12.75  
   • σ_com = √12.75 ≃ 3.57 percentage points  

   Total Customer Growth (%): [7, 6, 13, 8]  
   • Mean = (7+6+13+8)/4 = 8.5%  
   • Variance = [(–1.5)² + (–2.5)² + (4.5)² + (–0.5)²]/4  
               = (2.25 + 6.25 + 20.25 + 0.25)/4  
               = 7.25  
   • σ_tot = √7.25 ≃ 2.69 percentage points  

4. Compute the ratio of the standard deviations:

   Ratio = σ_com / σ_tot  
         ≃ 3.57 / 2.69  
         ≃ 1.33  

5. Interpretation:

   • The US commercial Q/Q growth rate exhibits a standard deviation ≃ 3.6 ppt, versus ≃ 2.7 ppt for total customers.  
   • Their ratio (1.33) means US commercial expansions quarter-to-quarter have been about 33% more volatile than total customer growth, even though management highlights a smooth “+65% Y/Y” increase for commercial customers (see the “US Commercial Customer Count” slide).  
   • In other words, beneath that strong 65% Y/Y headline, US commercial customer additions have swung more widely from quarter to quarter relative to the overall base.

### 1. Extract Unamortized Discount & Issuance Costs  
From Note 10 – Debt, “Long-Term Debt” (Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Form 10-Q):

| Date           | Unamortized debt discount & issuance costs (in $ million) |
|---------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------:|
| Jan 26, 2025   |                                                         (37)|

(Source: Note 10, “Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs” line.)

### 2. Determine Total Scheduled Long-Term Debt Principal  
Also in Note 10, the face amounts (carrying values before discount) by maturity:

| Note                                | Principal ($ million) |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------:|
| 3.20% due 2026                      |                  1,000|
| 1.55% due 2028                      |                  1,250|
| 2.85% due 2030                      |                  1,500|
| 2.00% due 2031                      |                  1,250|
| 3.50% due 2040                      |                  1,000|
| 3.50% due 2050                      |                  2,000|
| 3.70% due 2060                      |                    500|

(Source: Note 10, “Carrying Value” columns at Jan 26, 2025 and Apr 27, 2025.)

### 3. Compute Unamortized Costs as % of Principal  
For each date,  
    Unamortized discount % =  
    (Unamortized debt discount & issuance costs ÷ Total scheduled principal) × 100

- **Jan 26, 2025:**  
  = (37 / 8,500) × 100 ≈ 0.435 %

- **Apr 27, 2025:**  
  = (36 / 8,500) × 100 ≈ 0.424 %

### 4. Calculate the Change  
- Absolute change in unamortized costs:  
  37 million – 36 million = **1 million decrease**

- Change in percentage-of-principal:  
  0.435 % – 0.424 % = **0.011 percentage-point decrease**

---

#### Summary of Results  
Between January 26 and April 27, 2025:

- NVIDIA’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs fell by $1 million (from $37 m to $36 m).  
- As a percentage of the $8.5 billion of scheduled principal, this dropped from 0.435 % to 0.424 %, a decline of **0.011 percentage points**.

Source: Note 4 – “Income Taxes,” in NVIDIA’s Form 10-Q  

- **Statutory U.S. rate**: 21.0%  
- **Reported effective rate**: 14.3% of income before tax (Q1 FY2026 vs. 13.9% in Q1 FY2025)  
- **Primary drivers of the below-statutory rate**:  
  1. Benefit from the U.S. foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction  
  2. Lower tax benefit on stock-based compensation (compared with prior periods)  
  3. Income earned in jurisdictions taxed at rates below the U.S. federal rate  
  4. U.S. federal research & experimentation (“R&D”) tax credit  

  *(“Our effective tax rates … were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.”)*  

- **Comparative analysis**:  
  • Q1 FY2025 effective rate was 13.9%, up to 14.3% in Q1 FY2026 as the stock-compensation benefit declined; partially offset by stronger FDII deduction.  
  • Statutory vs. actual gap remains ~6.7 pp (21.0% – 14.3%).  

- **Market performance context**:  
  • Revenue: $44.1 billion, +69% Y/Y and +12% Q/Q  
  • Data Center: $39.1 billion, +73% Y/Y (+10% Q/Q)  
  • Networking: $5.0 billion, +56% Y/Y (+64% Q/Q)  
  • Gross margin: 60.5% vs. 78.4% a year ago (impacted by a $4.5 billion H20 inventory charge)  

- **Near-term outlook**:  
  Management “believe[s] that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.

"According to Nvidia’s cash flow statement, when it was incorrectly claimed that net cash used in investing activities exceeded share repurchases for the period, what were the actual figures for net cash used in investing activities versus share repurchases and how did dividends paid compare to payments for employee stock plan taxes?","Net cash used in investing activities was $5,216 million, which was less than the $14,095 million spent on share repurchases, and dividends paid were $244 million compared to $1,532 million of payments for employee stock plan taxes.","Here are the relevant line items from NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three-month period ended April 27, 2025 (all amounts in millions):  

| Cash flow caption                              | Amount  |
|------------------------------------------------|--------:|
| Net cash used in investing activities          |  (5,216)|
| Payments related to repurchases of common stock| (14,095)|

| Dividends paid                                 |     (244)|  

– Net cash used in investing activities was \$5,216 million, whereas share repurchases (i.e. payments to buy back common stock) totaled \$14,095 million.  
– Dividends paid of \$244 million were far smaller than the \$1,532 million paid for employee stock-plan tax withholding.

"On a quarter-over-quarter basis, by how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s net working capital change, by how many millions of dollars did its retained earnings increase, and what percentage of that retained earnings increase was consumed by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets?","NVIDIA’s net working capital increased by $1,314 million, retained earnings increased by $4,120 million, and purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets consumed 29.8% of that retained earnings increase.","Below is the quarter-over-quarter calculation (Jan 26, 2025 → Apr 27, 2025):

1. Net working capital change  
   -  Apr 27, 2025:  
      • Current assets = \$89,935 M  
      • Current liabilities = \$26,542 M  
      → NWC = 89,935 − 26,542 = \$63,393 M  
   -  Jan 26, 2025:  
      • Current assets = \$80,126 M  
      • Current liabilities = \$18,047 M  
      → NWC = 80,126 − 18,047 = \$62,079 M  
   -  Δ NWC = 63,393 − 62,079 = +\$1,314 M  
   (Increase of \$1.314 billion)  

2. Retained earnings increase  
   - Apr 27, 2025: \$72,158 M  
   - Jan 26, 2025: \$68,038 M  
   - Δ Retained Earnings = 72,158 − 68,038 = +\$4,120 M  

3. % of that increase consumed by capital purchases  
   - Purchases of property & equipment and intangible assets (CF-Investing): \$1,227 M  
   - % = 1,227 / 4,120 ≈ 29.8 %

"In Q1 FY26, following the USG’s April 9, 2025 export licensing requirements that diminished demand for H20 products, what percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales did NVIDIA’s related excess inventory charge represent, and by how many percentage points did that percentage exceed Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin?",The charge represented 97.8% of pre-licensing H20 sales and exceeded Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin by 53.8 percentage points.,"**Answer:**

- NVIDIA’s excess‐inventory charge was \$4.5 billion against \$4.6 billion of H₂O sales – about **98%** of pre-licensing H₂O revenue  
- Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin was **42%**  
- 98% – 42% = **56 percentage points**  

So, the charge represented roughly 98% of H₂O sales, exceeding Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin by about 56 points.

"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","The net expectation-to-market-stress ratio is 8.13×, which is 4.07× the 2.0× volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio versus a U.S. domestic bond portfolio.","Here’s how the two metrics stack up:

1.  Net share of investors expecting further USD depreciation  
   – 61 % (the highest “net” reading since 2006¹)

2.  Three-year rolling share of trading days when U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar all fell  
   – ≈ 7.5 % of days over the past three years²

   ⇒ 61 % ÷ 7.5 % ≃ 8.1

3.  Volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio vs. a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years  
   – Almost 2 ×³

Comparison:  
– The ratio of “net bearish USD” to “days of simultaneous U.S. asset sell-offs” is about 8 : 1.  
– By contrast, the unhedged ex-U.S. bond portfolio has exhibited roughly a 2 : 1 volatility pick-up.  

In other words, investors’ “dollar-bearishness” (8×) is about four times larger than the relative volatility penalty (2×) of holding unhedged foreign bonds.
