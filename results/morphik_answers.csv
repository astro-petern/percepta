"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Here are the requested numbers and our calculations, all drawn directly from Palantir’s Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2025 disclosures and the “Rule of 40” appendix:

1. Year-over-year revenue growth rates (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)  
   - Total revenue: 634 M → 884 M ⇒ +39 % Y/Y  (slide “Total revenue grew…”  
     &chart showing $634 M → $884 M, +39 %)  
   - Revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts: 610 M → 879 M ⇒ +44 % Y/Y  
     (slide “Total revenue excluding…” & appendix table: $610,440 k → $878,708 k)  
   - US revenue: grew +55 % Y/Y to $628 M  (highlight bullet: “US revenue grew +55 % Y/Y…”)  

2. Standard deviation across the three Y/Y growth rates [39 %, 44 %, 55 %]  
   – Mean growth = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 ≈ 46 %  
   – Deviations = [−7, −2, +9] ⇒ squared = [49, 4, 81] ⇒ avg. = (49+4+81)/3 ≈ 44.7  
   – SD ≈ √44.7 ≈ 6.7 percentage points  

3. Quarter-over-quarter changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 2023 → Q1 2025)  
   Rule of 40 values by quarter (from appendix):  
     Q2 2023 38 %, Q3 2023 46 %, Q4 2023 54 %, Q1 2024 57 %,  
     Q2 2024 64 %, Q3 2024 68 %, Q4 2024 81 %, Q1 2025 83 %.  

   The seven QoQ differences are:  
     46−38 = +8  
     54−46 = +8  
     57−54 = +3  
     64−57 = +7  
     68−64 = +4  
     81−68 = +13  
     83−81 = +2  

   – Mean change ≈ (8+8+3+7+4+13+2)/7 ≈ 6.43 pp  
   – Variance ≈ [(8−6.43)² + … + (2−6.43)²] / 7 ≈ 12.25  
   – SD ≈ √12.25 ≈ 3.5 percentage points  

4. Putting it together (“how do these volatility metrics relate to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score of 83 %?”)  
   - The three revenue growth streams display a moderate cross-sectional dispersion (SD ≈ 6.7 pp), driven largely by the extra strength in US revenue growth (+55 % Y/Y vs. +39 % total).  
   - The quarter-to-quarter Rule of 40 improvements have been remarkably steady—on average up ~+6.4 pp per quarter with an SD of only ~3.5 pp despite the business scaling and shifting mix.  
   - That low quarter-to-quarter volatility in the Rule of 40, combined with accelerating top-line growth and expanding margins, culminated in a record 83 % Rule of 40 in Q1 2025—more than double the 40 % “hurdle” and up from 38 % just two years earlier."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Here’s how you get to the ~25% drop in operating‐expense per U.S. commercial customer:

1. From the “Q1 2025 adjusted operating income…” chart:  
   - Q1 2024 Adjusted Op­er­ating Income = \$226 M at a 36% margin  
   - Q1 2025 Adjusted Op­er­ating Income = \$391 M at a 44% margin  

2. Infer Total Revenue (Ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts) from margin = Income÷Revenue:  
   - Q1 2024 Revenue ≈ \$226 M ÷ 36% ≃ \$628 M  
   - Q1 2025 Revenue ≈ \$391 M ÷ 44% ≃ \$889 M  

3. Compute Operating Expense = Revenue − Adjusted Operating Income:  
   - Q1 2024 Op-Ex ≃ \$628 M − \$226 M = \$402 M  
   - Q1 2025 Op-Ex ≃ \$889 M − \$391 M = \$498 M  

4. Divide by U.S. commercial customer counts (TTM ended March 31):  
   - Mar 31 2024 count = 262 → Op-Ex/customer ≃ \$402 M ÷ 262 ≃ \$1.53 M  
   - Mar 31 2025 count = 432 → Op-Ex/customer ≃ \$498 M ÷ 432 ≃ \$1.15 M  

5. Year-over-year change in Op-Ex per customer:  
   \[(\$1.15 M − \$1.53 M) ÷ \$1.53 M\] × 100% ≃ −24.9%  

→ Operating expense per U.S. commercial customer fell by roughly 25% from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in total other assets  
   - As of April 27 2025: $ 6,788 million  
     As of January 26 2025: $ 6,425 million  
   - Increase: 6,788 − 6,425 = $ 363 million  
   (Other Assets (Long Term) table)

2. Increase in assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets  
   - Q1 FY 2026: $ 408 million  
     Q1 FY 2025: $ 147 million  
   - Increase: 408 − 147 = $ 261 million  
   (Property and Equipment note)

3. Amortization expense as a percentage of Q1 FY 2026 assumed-liability acquisitions  
   - Amortization expense (Q1 FY 2026): $ 159 million  
   - Percentage: 159 ÷ 408 × 100 ≈ 39%  
   (Note 7 – Amortizable Intangible Assets and Goodwill)"
"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","The two relevant figures are:

- Fair value of the CoreWeave investment as of April 27, 2025: \$1 billion (or \$1,000 million) (see Note 5 footnote 1)  
- Carrying‐value reclassification adjustment in Q1 FY26: \$843 million (see “Reclassification” line in Note 6)

Accordingly, the fair value exceeded the reclassification adjustment by

\$1,000 million − \$843 million = \$157 million."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Here’s the data you asked for, drawn from Palantir’s Q1 2025 Investor Presentation:

1.  “Rule-of-40” components (false premise)  
    - Adjusted free cash-flow margin (Q1 2025): 42%  
    - US government revenue Q/Q growth (to Q1 2025): +9%  

2.  Quarter-end cash balance (cash, cash equivalents & US Treasuries):

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","Between the two aggregates, the “net change in unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities” plus “total other income (expense), net” grew faster year-over-year than “stock-based compensation expense” plus “depreciation and amortization” in the cash-flows.  

Calculation details:  

1)  Cash-flows line items (CF from Ops – Adjustments)  
   •  Stock-based comp. exp.  
      – Q1 ’25: \$ 1,474 M

"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","In fact, NVIDIA’s cash-flow statement shows that operating cash flow in Q1 FY-2026 was $27,414 million versus $15,345 million a year earlier—an increase of $12,069 million (≈ $12.1 billion).  Management specifically attributes the year-over-year uptick to:  
  - Higher revenue  
  - The timing of cash collections

"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","The Q1 2025 metrics break down as follows:

- Total revenue (GAAP) grew 39% Y/Y  
- Total revenue excluding “strategic commercial contracts” grew 44% Y/Y  

44% minus 39% = **5 percentage points**."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Below are the three requested metrics (all figures in millions except percentages):

1. Standard deviation of the Q-over-Q changes in estimated fair value by maturity  
   – “< 1 yr”: Δ = 25,781 – 18,450 =  7,331  
   – “1–5 yrs”: Δ = 26,355 – 23,656 =  2,699  
   – “Total”:   Δ = 52,136 – 42,106 = 10,030  

   Mean Δ = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030)/3 = 6,687  
   Population σ = √[ ((7,331–6,687)² + (2,699–6,687)² + (10,030–6,687)²) / 3 ]  
            ≈ √(27,498,488/3) ≈ √9,166,163 ≈ 3,028  

   → **≈ \$3,028 million**  

2. Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities at Jan 26, 2025  
   – From Note 5 (Jan 26 2025): corporate debt securities unrealized gain = **\$51 million**  

3. % increase in Level 1 money-market funds fair value  
   – Level 1 MMF at Jan 26: 3,760  
   – Level 1 MMF at Apr 27: 6,522  
   – Δ = 6,522 – 3,760 = 2,762  
   – %Δ = 2,762/3,760 × 100 ≈ **73.5 %**  

All gross unrealized losses were noted as being driven primarily by changes in interest rates."
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","Here’s the math, using the GAAP line‐item amounts shown on the charts (all in millions):

1. GAAP Operating Income  
   - Q3 2024 → Q4 2024 change:  
     11.0 − 113.1 = −102.1  
   - Q4 2024 → Q1 2025 change:  
     176.0 − 11.0 = 165.0  
   - Acceleration:  
     165.0 − (−102.1) = 267.1  

2. GAAP Net Income  
   - Q3 2024 → Q4 2024 change:  
     79.0 − 143.5 = −64.5  
   - Q4 2024 → Q1 2025 change:  
     214.0 − 79.0 = 135.0  
   - Acceleration:  
     135.0 − (−64.5) = 199.5  

3. Difference in accelerations  
   267.1 − 199.5 = 67.6  

So, the operating‐income acceleration exceeded net‐income acceleration by about **$67.6 million**."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many percentage points did NVIDIA’s excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of its total accrued and other current liabilities change, and as of April 27, 2025, what percentage of its net long-term carrying amount of debt are its outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations?","1. Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a % of total accrued & other current liabilities  
   - Jan 26, 2025:  
     • Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$ 2,095 M  
     • Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$ 11,737 M  
     → 2,095 / 11,737 ≈ 17.9%  
   - Apr 27, 2025:  
     • Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$ 4,310 M  
     • Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$ 19,211 M  
     → 4,310 / 19,211 ≈ 22.4%  
   - Change = 22.4% – 17.9% ≈ 4.5 percentage points  

2. Outstanding inventory purchase & long-term supply/capacity obligations as a % of net long-term debt (Apr 27, 2025)  
   - Purchase & supply obligations = \$ 29.8 B  
   - Net long-term carrying amount of debt = \$ 8.464 B  
   → 29.8 / 8.464 ≈ 3.52 ⇒ 352%

"For NVIDIA’s quarter ended April 27, 2025, what percentage of its remaining performance obligations for contracts greater than one year was unbilled, and for Palantir in Q1 2025, what percentage of its total remaining performance obligations was classified as long-term under its ASC 606 election?","Here are the answers, with supporting detail from each company’s disclosures:

1. NVIDIA (Quarter ended April 27, 2025)  
   – Remaining performance obligations for contracts >1 year: \$1.8 billion  
   – Of that, \$160 million “has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue”  
   – Unbilled percentage = \$160 M / \$1,800 M ≈ 8.9%  (≈ 9%)

2. Palantir (Q1 2025, ASC 606 RPO election)  
   – Total RPO: \$1.90 billion  
   – Long-term RPO: \$1.00 billion  
   – Long-term % = \$1.00 B / \$1.90 B ≈ 52.6%  (≈ 53%)

"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?","Between the TTM periods ended Mar 31, 2024 and Mar 31, 2025:  
- Global commercial customers grew from 427 to 622 (+195).  
- U.S. commercial customers grew from 262 to 432 (+170).  

Non-U.S. commercial customers therefore grew by:  
  (622 − 432) − (427 − 262)  
= 190 − 165  
= 25  

That 25 non-U.S. adds represents 25 ÷ 195 ≈ 12.8% (≈ 13%) of the total global commercial customer growth.

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","Between fiscal years 2026 and 2028 the carrying amount of NVIDIA’s future minimum operating‐lease obligations (excluding the first quarter of FY 2026) grew from $274 million to $349 million.  That represents a two-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of:

CAGR = (349 ÷ 274)^(1/2) – 1  
     ≈ (1.2745)^(0.5) – 1  
     ≈ 1.1288 – 1  
     ≈ 12.9%

This rising base of lease obligations is in line with NVIDIA’s disclosure that, “between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of $7.4 billion primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  In other words, the roughly 13 percent annual growth in booked lease obligations through FY 2028 foreshadows the even larger pipeline—$7.4 billion—of new data-center and office leases the company intends to put on its balance sheet from Q2 FY 2026 through FY 2030."
"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","Below is a quick back‐of‐the‐envelope comparison of the quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth volatilities for the US Commercial customer count versus the Total customer count over the four TTM quarters ending March 31, 2025.:

1.  US Commercial QoQ growth rates (TTM ended):  
    • Jun 30, ’24 vs Mar 31, ’24: +13%  
    • Sep 30, ’24 vs Jun 30, ’24: +9%  
    • Dec 31, ’24 vs Sep 30, ’24: +19%  
    • Mar 31, ’25 vs Dec 31, ’24: +13%  

2.  Total Customer QoQ growth rates (TTM ended):  
    • Jun 30, ’24 vs Mar 31, ’24: +7%  
    • Sep 30, ’24 vs Jun 30, ’24: +6%  
    • Dec 31, ’24 vs Sep 30, ’24: +13%  
    • Mar 31, ’25 vs Dec 31, ’24: +8%  

3.  Compute population‐std dev of each series:  
    – Commercial: σ ≈ √[{(13–13.5)²+(9–13.5)²+(19–13.5)²+(13–13.5)²}/4] ≈ 3.6 ppt  
    – Total:      σ ≈ √[{(7–8.5)²+(6–8.5)²+(13–8.5)²+(8–8.5)²}/4] ≈ 2.7 ppt  

4.  Ratio of volatilities:  
       σ_commercial  /  σ_total  ≈ 3.6 / 2.7 ≈ 1.3  

▶  This tells us that quarter‐to‐quarter US commercial customer additions have been roughly 30% more “bumpy” than overall customer adds, even though management is touting a smooth 65% year-over-year increase. In other words, the underlying QoQ swings in the commercial segment are materially larger than for the base as a whole, despite the strong headline Y/Y growth."
"For NVIDIA, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, what were the dollar increase in Interest income and the dollar decline in Other income (expense), net, and what was the primary driver identified for the change in Other income (expense), net?","- Interest income increased by \$156 million (from \$359 million in Q1 FY 2025 to \$515 million in Q1 FY 2026).  
- Other income (expense), net declined by \$255 million (from \$75 million income in Q1 FY 2025 to \$180 million expense in Q1 FY 2026).  
- The drop in Other income (expense), net was primarily driven by unrealized losses in NVIDIA’s publicly-held equity securities—most notably CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.—due to fair-value volatility in those investments.

   → Adjusted operating margin: 44%  

   If you back out that $390.7 M of adjusted operating income from Q1’25 revenue of $883.9 M, you get implied “adjusted operating expenses” of about $493.1 M—well north of the “sub-$450 M” remarked in the prepared remarks.  

3) Net income attributable to common stockholders  
   From “Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings Per Share, Diluted to Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Diluted” (Q1 2025):

   - + Employer payroll taxes on SBC: 59,323  
   - – Income tax effects & adjustments: (94,288)  
   = Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders (diluted): $334,405  

In short, the appendix shows:  
• Adjusted gross margin = 82%  
• Implied adjusted operating expenses ≈ $493 M (vs. “sub-$450 M” asserted)  
• GAAP net income to common = $214 M (vs. “$220 M” asserted)"

Morgan’s midyear report article “IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?” what is the difference in percentage points between the net percentage of investors expecting continued dollar depreciation and the year-to-date share of trading days in 2025 with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar as defined by the market-credibility metric in the “Tracking the market’s perception of the dollar” section?","The net share of investors expecting further dollar weakness (61%, footnote 11) minus the 2025 YTD share of “triples” days (5%) equals 56 percentage points."
"In Q1 FY26, following the USG’s April 9, 2025 export licensing requirements that diminished demand for H20 products, what percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales did NVIDIA’s related excess inventory charge represent, and by how many percentage points did that percentage exceed Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin?","Below is the math step by step:

1.  NVIDIA’s H2O charge as a percentage of pre-licensing H2O sales  
   – Charge: \$4.5 billion  
   – Pre-license sales: \$4.6 billion  
   – Percentage: (4.5 / 4.6) × 100 ≈ 97.8%

2.  Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin (from Palantir’s press release)  
   – Adjusted operating margin: ≈ 12.4%

3.  Difference in percentage-points  
   97.8 % – 12.4 % = 85.4 p.p.

Answer:  
NVIDIA’s \$4.5 billion H2O-related charge was roughly 97.8 % of the \$4.6 billion in pre-license sales—and that 97.8 % figure is about 85 percentage-points higher than Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin (≈ 12.4 %)."
"What is the full applicability date of the EU AI Act, what licensing requirement and compliance deadline would the US government's ""AI Diffusion"" IFR have imposed on NVIDIA's H200 and GB200 data center products, and which NVIDIA product category would the USG's ""Connected Vehicle"" import restrictions affect?","1. EU AI Act full applicability date  
   - The EU AI Act entered into force on August 1, 2024, and “will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period.”  (i.e. August 1, 2026)  

2. “AI Diffusion” IFR licensing requirement & deadline  
   - The USG’s “AI Diffusion” Interim Final Rule (published January 15, 2025) would have:  
     • Imposed a worldwide export licensing requirement on all items classified under ECCNs 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or the corresponding “.z” ECCNs (including related software/technology)  
     • Applied that requirement to NVIDIA’s leading data-center products (e.g. H200, GB200)  
     • Gone into effect 120 days after publication (i.e. mid-May 2025)  

3. “Connected Vehicle” import restrictions – affected NVIDIA category  
   - The USG’s “Connected Vehicle” measures target the import and sale of certain automotive products.  (i.e. NVIDIA’s Automotive product segment)"
"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","Here’s how the two ratios stack up:

1.    Net-share vs. market‐stress days  
      - Net share of investors expecting further dollar depreciation: 61 %¹  
      - Three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar: ≈ 7.5 %²  
      → Ratio ≈ 61 % ÷ 7.5 % ≃ 8.1 to 1  

2.    Volatility multiple of unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bonds vs. U.S. domestic bonds  
      - “A dollar-based investor in an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 2× the volatility of a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years.”³  

Comparison  
  – The “expectations vs. stress‐day” ratio (≈ 8 : 1) is roughly four times the “ex-U.S. vs. U.S. bond” volatility ratio (≈ 2 : 1).
