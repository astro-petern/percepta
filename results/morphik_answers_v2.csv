"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Here’s the walk‐through:

1.  Year-over-year revenue growth (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)  
   •  Total revenue: +39%  
   •  Revenue ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts: +44%  
   •  US revenue: +55%  

2.  Dispersion (standard deviation) of those three Y/Y rates  
   •  Data points: {39, 44, 55}  
   •  Mean = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46.0  
   •  Variance = [ (39–46)² + (44–46)² + (55–46)² ] / 3  
              = (49 + 4 + 81)/3 = 44.67  
   •  σ = √44.67 ≃ 6.7 percentage points  

3.  Quarter-over-quarter changes in Palantir’s Rule of 40 (Q2 2023→Q1 2025)  
   From the appendix:  
     Q2 ’23 38%,  
     Q3 ’23 46%  (+8)  
     Q4 ’23 54%  (+8)  
     Q1 ’24 57%  (+3)  
     Q2 ’24 64%  (+7)  
     Q3 ’24 68%  (+4)  
     Q4 ’24 81%  (+13)  
     Q1 ’25 83%  (+2)  

   The seven QoQ changes are {+8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2}.  
   •  Mean change = 45/7 ≃ 6.43  
   •  Variance = ∑(Δ–6.43)² / 7 ≃ 12.24  
   •  σ = √12.24 ≃ 3.5 percentage points  

4.  Relation to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 (83%)  
   •  The Rule of 40 at 83% sits a long way above both its long-run average (≈61% over these eight quarters) and the quarter-to-quarter swings (σ ≃3.5 pp).  
   •  Likewise, the dispersion in revenue-growth rates (σ ≃6.7 pp) is modest relative to the absolute level of operating leverage plus growth that the 83% Rule of 40 implies.  
   •  In plain English: despite normal up-and-down wobble in growth and profitability, Q1 ’25’s 83% Rule of 40 is well out on the high end of the historical band, underscoring the strength and consistency of the underlying momentum."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Here’s how you can arrive at the change in operating expense per U.S.‐commercial customer between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025:

1. Retrieve the two key line items:  
   - **Total revenue (ex‐ strategic commercial contracts)**  
     • Q1 2024: \$299 M (commercial) + \$335 M (government) = \$634 M  
     • Q1 2025: \$397 M (commercial) + \$487 M (government) = \$884 M  
   - **Adjusted operating income**  
     • Q1 2024: \$226 M (36% margin)  
     • Q1 2025: \$391 M (44% margin)

2. Compute **operating expense** (revenue minus adjusted operating income):  
   • Q1 2024: \$634 M – \$226 M = \$408 M  
   • Q1 2025: \$884 M – \$391 M = \$493 M

3. Pull the U.S. commercial customer counts (TTM to March 31):  
   • March 31, 2024: 262  
   • March 31, 2025: 432

4. Calculate **expense per customer**:  
   • Q1 2024: \$408 M ÷ 262 ≈ \$1.56 M/customer  
   • Q1 2025: \$493 M ÷ 432 ≈ \$1.14 M/customer

5. Finally, the **year-over-year change**:  
   (1.14 – 1.56) ÷ 1.56 ≈ –0.27 → **–27%**

**Answer:** The operating expense per U.S. commercial customer fell by about **27%** year-over-year from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","Here are the answers, with figures taken directly from NVIDIA’s 10-Q notes:

1.  Change in “Total other assets” (Long Term)  
    - Jan 26, 2025: $6,425 million

3.  Percentage of Q1 FY 2026 acquisitions represented by intangible-asset amortization  
    - Q1 FY 2026 acquisitions: $408 million

"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","Here are the two relevant figures (all amounts in millions):

- Fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment as of April 27, 2025 (Note 5, footnote 1): \$1,000  
- Carrying-value reclassification adjustment on non-marketable equity securities for Q1 FY26 (Note 6): \$843  

Calculation:  
\$1,000 – \$843 = \$157

**Answer:** The fair value exceeded the reclassification adjustment by \$157 million."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Here’s the “pseudo‐Rule-of-40” build-up under that (incorrect) premise and the other Q1’25 stats you asked for:

1. Assumed components of the 83% “Rule of 40”  
   - Adjusted free cash flow margin (Q1 2025): 42%¹  
   - US Government revenue Q/Q growth (Q1 2025): + 9%²  
   → 42% + 9% = 51% (**not** 83%, hence the premise is false)

2. Quarter-end liquidity (cash, cash equivalents & US Treasury securities):  
   → $5.4 billion³

3. Number of deals ≥ $1 million closed in Q1 2025:  
   → 139 deals⁴

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","The combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net grew faster year-over-year.  

Calculation details:  

1.  Cash-flow adjustments  
    -  Stock-based compensation: 1,474 (’25) vs. 1,011 (’24)  
    -  Depreciation & amortization:     611 (’25) vs.   410 (’24)  
    → Combined (’25) = 2,085; Combined (’24) = 1,421  
    → Growth = (2,085 – 1,421) / 1,421 ≈ 46.7%  

2.  Income-statement items  
    -  Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities: +139 (’25) vs. –128 (’24)  
    -  Total other income (expense), net:                   +272 (’25) vs. +370 (’24)  
    → Combined (’25) = 411; Combined (’24) = 242

"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","In fact, Nvidia’s cash flow from operations jumped from $15,345 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to $27,414 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026—a year-over-year increase of $12,069 million.  Management attributes the surge primarily to stronger revenue and the timing of cash collections.  

‐ Net cash provided by operating activities  
 • Q1 ’25: $15,345 M                  Q1 ’26: $27,414 M  
 • Δ = + $12,069 M  

‐ Drivers (“Liquidity and Capital Resources”):  
 • Higher revenue  
 • Timing of cash collections"
"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","The Y/Y growth rate ex-strategic commercial contracts was 44%, versus 39% for total revenue — a 5 percentage‐point difference."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Below are the three requested metrics, all drawn from NVIDIA’s Q1 2026 (April 27, 2025) and Q4 2025 (January 26, 2025) disclosures:

1.  Standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across contractual maturities  
    — Less than 1 year moved from \$18,450 mm to \$25,781 mm:   Δ = +\$7,331 mm  
    — Due in 1–5 years moved from \$23,656 mm to \$26,355 mm:   Δ = +\$2,699 mm  
    — Total moved from \$42,106 mm to \$52,136 mm:             Δ = +\$10,030 mm  

    Computing the (population) standard deviation of {7,331; 2,699; 10,030}:
    ```
    mean = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030) / 3 = 6,686.7
    σ    = sqrt [ ((7,331–6,686.7)² + (2,699–6,686.7)² + (10,030–6,686.7)²) / 3 ]
         ≈ $3,028 million
    ```

2.  Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities as of January 26, 2025  
    From the “Corporate debt securities” line in the January 26, 2025 summary:  
    **Unrealized gain = \$51 million**  

3.  Percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value  
    From Note 6 – Fair Value of Financial Assets (Level 1):  
    – Jan 26, 2025: \$3,760 million  
    – Apr 27, 2025: \$6,522 million  

    ```
    % increase = (6,522 – 3,760) / 3,760 × 100% ≈ 73.4%
    ```

Finally, NVIDIA notes that its gross unrealized losses on fixed-income securities “were driven primarily by changes in interest rates,” underscoring that the mark-to-market movements above are largely rate-related."
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","Here’s the math, using the GAAP line items from the charts:

1. GAAP Operating Income  
   – Q3 2024 → Q4 2024 change: $11.0 M – $113.1 M = – $102.1 M  
   – Q4 2024 → Q1 2025 change: $176.0 M – $11.0 M = + $165.0 M  
   – “Acceleration” = 165.0 – (–102.1) = + $267.1 M  

2. GAAP Net Income  
   – Q3 2024 → Q4 2024 change: $79.0 M – $143.5 M = – $64.5 M  
   – Q4 2024 → Q1 2025 change: $214.0 M – $79.0 M = + $135.0 M  
   – “Acceleration” = 135.0 – (–64.5) = + $199.5 M  

3. Difference in “accelerations”  
   = $267.1 M – $199.5 M = $67.6 M  

So, the bounce‐back in GAAP operating income accelerated by about $67.6 million more than the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many percentage points did NVIDIA’s excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of its total accrued and other current liabilities change, and as of April 27, 2025, what percentage of its net long-term carrying amount of debt are its outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations?","1. Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of total accrued and other current liabilities  
   - Jan 26, 2025: 2,095 / 11,737 = 17.9%  
   - Apr 27, 2025: 4,310 / 19,211 = 22.4%  
   → Increase of 22.4% − 17.9% ≈ 4.5 percentage points  

2. Outstanding inventory purchase & long-term supply obligations vs. net long-term debt (as of Apr 27, 2025)  
   - Obligations: $29.8 billion (Note 11)  
   - Net long-term carrying amount of debt: $8.464 billion (Note 10)

"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?","Between the TTM periods ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025:

- Global commercial customers grew from 427 to 622, an increase of 195 customers.  
- US commercial customers grew from 262 to 432, an increase of 170 customers.  

Therefore non-US commercial customers went from (427 – 262)=165 to (622 – 432)=190, a net addition of 190 – 165=25 customers.  
Those 25 non-US adds represent 25/195≈12.8% (≈13%) of the total 195-customer global commercial growth.

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","Between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028, NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations grow from \$274 million to \$349 million.  That implies a two-year CAGR of:

\[
\bigl(349/274\bigr)^{1/2} - 1 
\;\approx\; 12.8\%
\]

In other words, lease commitments have been rising at roughly a 13% annual clip in that window.  This uptick in existing lease obligations sets the stage for NVIDIA’s announced expansion: between Q2 FY 2026 and the end of FY 2030, the company expects to commence additional data-center and office operating leases totaling \$7.4 billion (with terms ranging from 2 to 15.5 years).  The roughly 13% CAGR over FY 2026–28 underscores the platform on which this next wave of \$7.4 billion in new leases will be built.

"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","Below is a back‐of‐the‐envelope calculation of the quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) volatility in US Commercial customer adds versus Total customer adds for the four quarters ending Mar 31, 2025:

1. Quarter-over-quarter growth rates  
   - US Commercial Customer Count QoQ: +9%, +7%, +15%, +9%  
     (427→467, 467→498, 498→571, 571→622)  
   - Total Customer Count QoQ: +7%, +6%, +13%, +8%  
     (554→593, 593→629, 629→711, 711→769)

2. Standard deviations (population basis)  
   - σ(Commercial) ≈ 3.0%  
   - σ(Total) ≈ 2.7%

3. Ratio of volatilities  
   σ(Commercial) / σ(Total) ≈ 3.0% / 2.7% ≈ 1.1  

What this means  
- Despite a very strong 65% Y/Y expansion in US Commercial customers, the quarter-to-quarter swings are quite muted.  
- The commercial segment’s QoQ volatility is only about 10% higher than that of the total customer base—i.e. the commercial rollout has been only slightly bumpier than the company overall.  
- In other words, management’s headline “+65% Y/Y” growth in US Commercial isn’t being driven by one massive quarter; it represents a reasonably steady acceleration."
"For NVIDIA, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, what were the dollar increase in Interest income and the dollar decline in Other income (expense), net, and what was the primary driver identified for the change in Other income (expense), net?","Here are the key movements in the quarter-to-quarter Other Income (Expense), Net line items for Q1 FY26 vs. Q1 FY25:

"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the change in Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs expressed as a percentage of the total scheduled long-term debt principal across all maturity buckets?","The unamortized debt discount & issuance costs fell from \$37 million at January 26, 2025 to \$36 million at April 27, 2025—a \$1 million decrease.  Since the total scheduled long-term note principal across all maturities is \$8,500 million, that \$1 million change represents:

   \$1 million ÷ \$8,500 million ≃ 0.0001176, or about 0.012%

In other words, the unamortized debt discount & issuance costs declined by roughly 0.01% of the total note principal.

- For Q1 FY 2026 (quarter ended April 27, 2025), NVIDIA reported:
  - Interest income of \$515 million  
  - Interest expense of \$63 million  
  → Interest coverage ratio = 515 / 63 ≈ **8.2×**

   (See “Governments and regulators… For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period.”)

2. “AI Diffusion” IFR licensing requirement & deadline  
   On January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” Interim Final Rule.  
   – It would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under certain ECCNs (e.g. 3A090.a, 4A090.a, and corresponding “.z” ECCNs), “including all related software and technology.”  
   – This requirement would have applied to NVIDIA’s H200 and GB200 data-center products.  
   – Licenses would have been required after a 120-day delayed compliance period (i.e. by mid-May 2025).  
   (See “After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs… including … H200 and GB200.”)

3. “Connected Vehicle” import restrictions – affected product category  
   The USG’s “Connected Vehicle” restrictions target the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States.  
   – These would affect NVIDIA’s Automotive product category.  
   (See “For example, the USG adopted ‘Connected Vehicle’ restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States…”)"
"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","The two metrics in question are  

1. The “sentiment‐to‐stress” ratio  
   - Numerator: the net share of fund managers expecting further U.S.-dollar depreciation (61 %)  
   - Denominator: the three-year rolling percentage of trading days on which U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar all fell (~7.5 %)  
   ⇒ 61 % ÷ 7.5 % ≈ 8.1  

2. The “volatility multiple”  
   - The volatility of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio has been almost 2 × that of a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio over the past 20 years.  

Putting those side-by-side:  

• The ratio of “net depreciation bets” to “simultaneous U.S.-asset sell‐offs” is roughly 8 to 1.  
• By contrast, the relative volatility of an unhedged ex-U.S. bond portfolio versus a U.S.-dollar bond portfolio is about 2 to 1.  

In other words, investors’ conviction about further dollar weakness (61 % vs. 7.5 %) implies an 8× signal, which is about four times larger than the 2× volatility penalty of holding unhedged ex-U.S. bonds.
