"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Here’s a summary of the key growth‐and‐volatility numbers for Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2025, and how they stack up against the recent volatility of the Rule-of-40 score:

1. Year-over-year revenue growth rates  
   • Total Revenue (634 → 884 MM): +39% (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)  
     (slide: “Total revenue grew 39% Y/Y and 7% Q/Q to $884 million”)  
   • Total Revenue excl. Strategic Commercial (610 → 879 MM): +44%  
     (slide: “Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts grew 44% Y/Y…”)  
   • US Revenue (406 → 628 MM): +55%  
     (slide: “US revenue grew +55% Y/Y… to $628 million”)

2. Dispersion of those three Y/Y growth rates  
   • Values: {39%, 44%, 55%}  
   • Mean = 46.0%  
   • Population-σ = √[ ((39–46)² + (44–46)² + (55–46)²)/3 ] ≃ 6.7 percentage points  

3. Quarter-over-quarter Rule-of-40 changes, Q2 2023→Q1 2025  
   From the “Reconciliation of Rule of 40” slide, the Rule-of-40 scores are  
     Q2 ’23 38%, Q3 ’23 46%, Q4 ’23 54%, Q1 ’24 57%, Q2 ’24 64%, Q3 ’24 68%, Q4 ’24 81%, Q1 ’25 83%  
   ⇒ Δs = {+8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2} (in p.p.)  
   • Mean Δ ≃ +6.43 p.p.  
   • Population-σ = √[Σ(Δ–6.43)²/7] ≃ 3.5 p.p.  

4. How these volatilities relate to Q1 2025’s Rule-of-40 = 83%  
   – The three Y/Y revenue-growth rates cluster within ±6.7 p.p. of their 46% average, showing moderate dispersion across geographies/adjustments.  
   – The Rule-of-40 has moved quarter to quarter with a σ of only ~3½ p.p., yet in Q1 2025 it hit an all-time high of 83%.  
   – In other words, Palantir’s growth and profitability metric (R-40) has exhibited relatively low quarter-to-quarter volatility, and yet has steadily marched upward to a very strong 83% in Q1 2025—well above both its historical average (~61%) and its typical quarterly swing (~±3.5 p.p.)."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Below is a back-of-the-envelope calculation using Q1 figures from Palantir’s appendix:

1. Q1 2024  
   – Revenue ex-strat: \$610.4 M  
   – Adj. Op. Inc.: \$226.5 M  
   => Implied Op. Expense = 610.4 – 226.5 = \$383.9 M  
   – US-Commercial Customers (TTM Mar 31 ’24): 262  
   => Expense per customer = 383.9 ÷ 262 ≈ \$1.466 M  

2. Q1 2025  
   – Revenue ex-strat: \$878.7 M  
   – Adj. Op. Inc.: \$390.7 M  
   => Implied Op. Expense = 878.7 – 390.7 = \$488.0 M  
   – US-Commercial Customers (TTM Mar 31 ’25): 432  
   => Expense per customer = 488.0 ÷ 432 ≈ \$1.130 M  

3. Year-over-year change  
   (1.130 – 1.466) ÷ 1.466 ≈ –0.771 ⇒ –22.9%

Answer: Operating expense per US commercial customer fell by about 23% year-over-year from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in total other assets  
   - As of April 27, 2025, “Total other assets” was $6,788 million; as of January 26, 2025, it was $6,425 million.  
   - Change = $6,788 M − $6,425 M = **+$363 million**  
   (Source: “Other Assets (Long Term)” table)

2. Increase in assumed-liability acquisitions  
   - First quarter FY 2026: $408 million  
   - First quarter FY 2025: $147 million  
   - Increase = $408 M − $147 M = **$261 million**  
   (Source: “Property, equipment and intangible assets acquired by assuming related liabilities…”)

3. Intangible-asset amortization as a percentage of Q1 FY 2026 acquisitions  
   - Q1 FY 2026 amortization expense: $159 million  
   - Q1 FY 2026 assumed-liability acquisitions: $408 million  
   - Percentage = ($159 M / $408 M) × 100 ≈ **39%**  
   (Source: “Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was $159 million…” in Note 7)"
"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","The CoreWeave investment was carried at a fair value of $1 billion as of April 27, 2025 (Note 5(1)), and the reclassification out of long-term non-marketable equity securities was $843 million (Note 6).  The difference is:  

$1,000 million – $843 million = $157 million."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Here are the figures under the hypothetical that Palantir’s 83% Rule of 40 in Q1 2025 came from:

1. Adjusted free cash flow margin: 42%  
   (Reconciliation of Cash Flow slide, “Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin”)

2. US government revenue Q/Q growth: + 9%  
   (Business Update highlights, “US government revenue grew … +9% Q/Q to $373 million”)

3. Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities: $ 5.4 billion  
   (Financials slide, “We ended Q1 2025 with $ 5.4 B in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities and no debt.”)

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","**Answer: The “net unrealized gains + other income, net” line grew faster – by about 23 percentage points.**

---

**1. Stock-based comp. + Depreciation & amortization (Cash Flows from Ops)**  
(from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, 3 months ended)  
• Apr 27, 2025  
  – Stock-based comp.: $1,474 M  
  – Depreciation & amortization: $611 M  
  – Combined = $2,085 M  
• Apr 28, 2024  
  – Stock-based comp.: $1,011 M  
  – Depreciation & amort.: $410 M  
  – Combined = $1,421 M  

YoY growth = (2,085 – 1,421) / 1,421 ≈ 0.467 ⇒ 46.7%  

**2. Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities + Total other income (expense), net**  
– Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities  
  (from Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income)  
  • Apr 27, 2025:  + $139 M  
  • Apr 28, 2024:  – $128 M  
– Total other income (expense), net  
  (from Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income)  
  • Apr 27, 2025:  $272 M  
  • Apr 28, 2024:  $370 M  

Combined:  
• Apr 27, 2025 = 139 + 272 = $411 M  
• Apr 28, 2024 = – 128 + 370 = $242 M  

YoY growth = (411 – 242) / 242 ≈ 0.698 ⇒ 69.8%  

---

**Difference in growth rates**  
69.8% (AFS unrealized + other income) – 46.7% (stock-based comp + D&A) ≈ **23.1 percentage points**."
"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","Here’s what the Form 10-Q actually shows for Q1 FY 2026 (three months ended April 27, 2025) versus Q1 FY 2025 (ended April 28, 2024):

• Net cash provided by operating activities  
    – Q1 FY 2026: $ 27,414 million  
    – Q1 FY 2025: $ 15,345 million  
    = Year-over-year increase of $ 12,069 million  

• Management’s explanation (MD&A, “Liquidity and Capital Resources”):  
  “Cash provided by operating activities increased … due to higher revenue and timing of cash collections.”  

So, rather than falling, operating‐cash‐flow rose by about $12.1 billion, driven primarily by stronger revenue and the timing of customer collections."
"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?",The year-over-year growth rate ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts (44% Y/Y) exceeded the overall total revenue growth rate (39% Y/Y) by 5 percentage points. (44% − 39% = 5%)
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Below are the three answers, based on the tables in Note 5 (debt by contractual maturity) and Note 6 (Level 1 money market funds) and the Jan 26, 2025 mark-to-market table:

1. Quarter-over-quarter Δ in estimated fair value by maturity  
   • < 1 year: 25,781 – 18,450 = + 7,331   
   • 1–5 years:  26,355 – 23,656 = + 2,699   
   • Total:      52,136 – 42,106 = + 10,030   

   Population standard deviation of (7,331; 2,699; 10,030)  
   = √[ ((7,331–6,686.7)²+(2,699–6,686.7)²+(10,030–6,686.7)²)/3 ]  
   ≈ $3,027 million  

2. Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities at Jan 26, 2025  
   From the Jan 26, 2025 “Corporate debt securities” line in Note 5:  
   Unrealized gain = $51 million  

3. % increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value  
   Level 1 MMF at Jan 26 = $3,760 million  
   Level 1 MMF at Apr 27 = $6,522 million  
   Δ = (6,522 – 3,760)/3,760 ≈ 73.4%  

(As the company notes, the gross unrealized losses were driven principally by interest-rate movements.)"
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","First, extract the relevant GAAP figures (all in millions):

  • GAAP Operating Income  
    – Q3 2024: $113.1  
    – Q4 2024: $11.0  
    – Q1 2025: $176.0  

  • GAAP Net Income  
    – Q3 2024: $143.5  
    – Q4 2024: $79.0  
    – Q1 2025: $214.0  

Compute the two “quarter-to-quarter” changes and then their difference (“acceleration”):

1. GAAP Operating Income  
   • Q3→Q4 2024 change = $11.0 – $113.1 = –\$102.1  
   • Q4 2024→Q1 2025 change = $176.0 – $11.0 = +\$165.0  
   • Operating Income acceleration = 165.0 – (–102.1) = +\$267.1  

2. GAAP Net Income  
   • Q3→Q4 2024 change = $79.0 – $143.5 = –\$64.5  
   • Q4 2024→Q1 2025 change = $214.0 – $79.0 = +\$135.0  
   • Net Income acceleration = 135.0 – (–64.5) = +\$199.5  

Finally, subtract the net-income acceleration from the operating-income acceleration:

  \$267.1 – \$199.5 ≃ **\$67.6 million**

So, after the SAR expense hit in Q4 2024, the uptick in GAAP operating income accelerated by about \$67 million more than the uptick in GAAP net income."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many percentage points did NVIDIA’s excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of its total accrued and other current liabilities change, and as of April 27, 2025, what percentage of its net long-term carrying amount of debt are its outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations?","1. Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of total accrued and other current liabilities  
   - As of January 26, 2025:  
     Excess obligations $2,095 M ÷ Total accrued & other current liabilities $11,737 M = 17.9%  
   - As of April 27, 2025:  
     Excess obligations $4,310 M ÷ Total accrued & other current liabilities $19,211 M = 22.4%  
   - Difference: 22.4% – 17.9% = **4.5 percentage points** ↑  

   (Source: Note 8 “Accrued and Other Current Liabilities”)

2. Outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations as a percentage of net long-term carrying amount of debt (April 27, 2025)  
   - Obligations: $29.8 B (Note 11)  
   - Net long-term carrying amount of debt: $8.464 B (Note 10)  
   - Ratio: $29.8 B ÷ $8.464 B ≈ 3.52 ⇒ **352%**

"For NVIDIA’s quarter ended April 27, 2025, what percentage of its remaining performance obligations for contracts greater than one year was unbilled, and for Palantir in Q1 2025, what percentage of its total remaining performance obligations was classified as long-term under its ASC 606 election?","1. NVIDIA (Quarter ended April 27, 2025)  
   As disclosed in Note 2 (Deferred Revenue) to the April 27, 2025 Form 10-Q:  
   “Revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in length was $1.8 billion, which includes $1.6 billion of deferred revenue and $160 million which has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue.”  
   ⇒ Unbilled portion = $160 million ÷ $1,800 million ≈ 8.9%  

2. Palantir (Q1 2025, ASC 606 practical expedient)  
   In Palantir’s Q1 2025 appendix under “Additional Metrics and Notes,” total RPO was $1.90 billion, of which $1.00 billion was classified as long-term (the balance being short-term).

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","**Answer:** 

Between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028, NVIDIA’s operating‐lease obligations grow from \$274 million to \$349 million.  The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over that two-year span is:

  
CAGR = (349 / 274)^(1/2) – 1 ≈ 1.2737^(0.5) – 1 ≈ 12.8% per year  

This rising trend in lease obligations foreshadows NVIDIA’s announced plan to further expand its facility footprint.  As noted in the financial statement, “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of \$7.4 billion, primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  In other words, the ~13% CAGR in existing operating-lease liabilities through FY 2028 is consistent with—and a precursor to—the much larger \$7.4 billion of new data-center and office leases scheduled to begin in Q2 FY 2026 and run through FY 2030.

"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","Below is a brief calculation of the quarter-over-quarter (Q/Q) growth‐rate volatility for both series over the four quarters ending March 31, 2025, and the resulting ratio:

1. Extract the Q/Q growth rates from the charts  
   - US Commercial Customer Count (TTM QoQ): 13%, 9%, 19%, 13%  
   - Total Customer Count (TTM QoQ): 7%, 6%, 13%, 8%

2. Compute the (population) standard deviations  
   - σ (commercial) = √[[(13–13.5)² + (9–13.5)² + (19–13.5)² + (13–13.5)²] / 4] ≈ 3.57%  
   - σ (total)      = √[[(7–8.5)² + (6–8.5)² + (13–8.5)² + (8–8.5)²] / 4] ≈ 2.69%

3. Form the ratio  
   ratio = σ (commercial) / σ (total) ≈ 3.57% / 2.69% ≈ **1.33**

What it implies  
Even though management highlights a very strong **+65% year-over-year** increase in US commercial customer count, the underlying **quarter-to-quarter** changes in that segment are about one-and-a-third times more variable than those for the total customer base. In other words, US commercial growth exhibits noticeably higher short-term volatility despite its robust annual trend."
"For NVIDIA, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, what were the dollar increase in Interest income and the dollar decline in Other income (expense), net, and what was the primary driver identified for the change in Other income (expense), net?","For the first quarter of FY 2026 versus Q1 FY 2025, NVIDIA’s:  

- Interest income rose by $156 million (from $359 million to $515 million).  
- Other income (expense), net fell by $255 million (from a $75 million gain to a $180 million loss).  

The year-over-year decline in Other income (expense), net was driven “primarily by unrealized losses in our publicly-held equity securities due to fair value volatility in our investments, particularly CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.”¹

"Management asserted that Palantir delivered an 85% adjusted gross margin, sub-$450 million of adjusted expenses, and $220 million of net income attributable to common stockholders in Q1 2025; what do the reconciliation tables actually report for those three metrics?","Here’s what the appendix reconciliation schedules actually show for Q1 2025 (all figures in thousands, except margins):

1.  Adjusted Gross Margin  
    – From the “Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit & Adjusted Gross Margin” table:  
      • Adjusted Gross Profit = \$725,901  
      • Revenue (from other slides) = \$884 million  
      • Adjusted Gross Margin = 82%  

2.  Adjusted Expenses  
    – From the “Reconciliation of Cost of Revenue and Total Operating Expenses to Adjusted Expenses” table:  
      • Total Expenses = \$707,807  
      • Less: Stock-Based Compensation     \$155,339  
      • Less: Employer Payroll Taxes       \$59,323  
      → Adjusted Expenses = \$493,145  

3.  Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders  
    – From the “Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings Per Share, Diluted to Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Diluted” table:  
      • Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders = \$214,031  

In short, the reconciliations show  
– Adjusted gross margin of 82% (not 85%)  
– Adjusted expenses of \$493 million (not sub-\$450 million)  
– GAAP net income to common of \$214 million (versus the \$220 million asserted)"
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the change in Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs expressed as a percentage of the total scheduled long-term debt principal across all maturity buckets?","Below is a brief calculation based on the Note 10 “Debt” disclosures (see pages 16 and 29 of the PDF):

1. Total long-term debt principal (all maturities) as of both dates:  
   3,750 + 1,250 + 3,500 = 8,500 million

2. Unamortized debt discount & issuance costs:  
   • Jan 26, 2025: \$37 million  
   • Apr 27, 2025: \$36 million

3. As a percentage of total principal:  
   • Jan 26, 2025: 37 / 8,500 ≈ 0.4353%  
   • Apr 27, 2025: 36 / 8,500 ≈ 0.4235%

4. Change (Apr 27 vs. Jan 26):  
   0.4235% − 0.4353% = –0.0118 percentage points  

In other words, the unamortized discount and issuance costs fell by approximately 0.012 % of the total scheduled long-term debt principal (about 1.2 basis points)."

Morgan’s 2025 Mid-Year Outlook):

1. Net share expecting further USD depreciation  
   “Nearly 70% of investors surveyed think the dollar is ‘overvalued,’ and a net 61%, the highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to depreciate.”¹  

2. Three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous U.S. stock, bond and dollar declines

3. Volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio vs. a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio  
   “A dollar-based investor in an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 2× the volatility of a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years.”³  

Putting (1) and (2) together:  
– Ratio = net share expecting depreciation ÷ share of triple-decline days  
– Ratio ≈ 61% ÷ 7.5% ≃ 8.1  

By comparison, the unhedged ex-U.S. bond portfolio’s volatility is only about 2× that of domestic bonds. In other words, the market’s bearish dollar sentiment (≈ 8 to 1) is roughly four times larger than the cross-border bond-volatility premium (≈ 2 to 1).
