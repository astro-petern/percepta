"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and US revenue grew 39%, 44% and 55% year-over-year, respectively; the standard deviation of those growth rates was 6.68 percentage points; the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 to Q1 2025 was 3.50 percentage points; and these volatility measures align with the Company’s 83% Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025.","Here’s the analysis in three parts:

1) Quarterly revenue growth rates and their cross‐series volatility  
2) Quarter‐on‐quarter changes in Rule of 40 and their volatility  
3) How those “volatility” figures compare with the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 (83%)

---

## 1. Y/Y growth rates and SD across the three series  

From the Q1 2024 / Q1 2025 slides:

- Total revenue grew from \$634 M → \$884 M, +39% Y/Y  
- Revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts grew from \$610 M → \$879 M, +44% Y/Y  
- US revenue grew from \$406 M → \$628 M, +55% Y/Y  

Compute the standard deviation (σ) of the three growth rates {39%, 44%, 55%}.  
- Mean μ = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 ≈ 46.0%  
- Var = [ (39−46)² + (44−46)² + (55−46)² ]/3 ≈ 44.67  
- σ ≈ √44.67 ≈ **6.7 percentage points**

## 2. Q-on-Q changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 2023 → Q1 2025) and SD  

From the “Reconciliation of Rule of 40” table:  

Quarter  Rule of 40  
Q2 2023  38%  
Q3 2023  46%  
Q4 2023  54%  
Q1 2024  57%  
Q2 2024  64%  
Q3 2024  68%  
Q4 2024  81%  
Q1 2025  83%  

ΔQoQ = {+8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2} (seven intervals)  
- Mean Δ = ≈6.43 pp  
- VarΔ = Σ(Δ­i –6.43)² / 7 ≈ 12.25  
- σΔ ≈ √12.25 ≈ **3.5 percentage points**  

---

## 3. Relating volatility to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 (83%)  

- Q1 2025’s Rule of 40 of **83%** sits well above the 40% “hurdle” and represents the latest point in a steadily-rising series.  
- The **6.7 pp** SD across revenue growth rates shows moderate dispersion around an average ~46% Y/Y growth—i.e. all three series are growing robustly, but not in perfect lock‐step.  
- The **3.5 pp** SD in quarter‐on‐quarter Rule of 40 improvements confirms that Palantir’s margin + growth trade-off has been **consistently accretive** each quarter (all Δ’s positive), with only modest quarter-to-quarter swings around an average ~+6.4 pp gain.  

In sum, the fairly low volatilities (relative to the levels themselves) reinforce that Palantir’s Q1 2025 Rule of 40 outcome (83%) is part of a smooth upward trend, rather than the result of one‐off spikes.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?",Palantir’s operating expense per US commercial customer decreased by 22.93% year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025.,"Here’s how the change in operating expense per US commercial customer breaks down:

1. Key figures  
   - Q1 2024  
     • Revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts: \$610 M  
     • Adjusted operating income:             \$226 M  
     • US commercial customers (TTM Mar 31, ’24): 262  
   - Q1 2025  
     • Revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts: \$879 M  
     • Adjusted operating income:             \$391 M  
     • US commercial customers (TTM Mar 31, ’25): 432  

2. Compute operating expense  
   Operating expense = (Revenue excl.) − (Adjusted Op Inc)  
   - Q1 ’24: 610 – 226 = \$384 M  
   - Q1 ’25: 879 – 391 = \$488 M  

3. Per‐customer expense  
   – Q1 ’24: \$384 M / 262 ≈ \$1.466 M/customer  
   – Q1 ’25: \$488 M / 432 ≈ \$1.130 M/customer  

4. Year-over-year % change  
   (1.130 – 1.466) / 1.466 ≈ –0.229 ≃ –23%

- GAAP operating income  
  • Q3 2024 → Q4 2024: 11.0 – 113.1 = –102.1 M  
  • Q4 2024 → Q1 2025: 176.0 – 11.0 = +165.0 M  
  ⇒ Acceleration = 165.0 – (–102.1) = +267.1 M  

- GAAP net income  
  • Q3 2024 → Q4 2024: 79.0 – 143.5 = –64.5 M  
  • Q4 2024 → Q1 2025: 214.0 – 79.0 = +135.0 M

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?",The compound annual growth rate of operating lease obligations from fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2028 was 12.86% and this growth aligns with the company’s expectation to commence $7.4 billion of data center and office operating leases between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030.,"**Answer:**

Between FY 2026 and FY 2028 NVIDIA’s scheduled operating‐lease obligations rise from \$274 million to \$349 million.  Over that two‐year span, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is:

CAGR = (349 / 274)^(1/2) – 1 ≈ 12.8%

(Note: (349/274)=1.273, √1.273≈1.128 ⇒ 1.128–1 = 0.128 or 12.8%.)

**Relation to the Q2 FY 2026–FY 2030 Lease Roll-Out**  
NVIDIA has disclosed that “between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of \$7.4 billion primarily for data center and office operating leases” (Note 14).

"According to Nvidia’s cash flow statement, when it was incorrectly claimed that net cash used in investing activities exceeded share repurchases for the period, what were the actual figures for net cash used in investing activities versus share repurchases and how did dividends paid compare to payments for employee stock plan taxes?","Net cash used in investing activities was $5,216 million, which was less than the $14,095 million spent on share repurchases, and dividends paid were $244 million compared to $1,532 million of payments for employee stock plan taxes.","Here are the actual numbers for the three-months ended April 27, 2025, from the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:

- Net cash used in investing activities: $ 5,216 million  
- Payments related to repurchases of common stock (“share repurchases”): $ 14,095 million  

  So in fact share buy-backs exceeded the investing cash outflow by roughly $ 9 billion, not the other way around.

- Payments related to employee stock plan taxes: $ 1,532 million  
- Dividends paid: $ 244 million  

  Dividends were therefore only about one-sixth the size of the tax-withholding payments for employee equity awards.

"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","The net expectation-to-market-stress ratio is 8.13×, which is 4.07× the 2.0× volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio versus a U.S. domestic bond portfolio.","The two metrics you’re asking about are pulled from our “Downfall of the U.S. dollar?” and “Portfolio resilience” sections and break down as follows:

1. Investor sentiment vs. market “risk‐off” days  
   -  Net share of investors who expect further U.S. dollar depreciation: 61%¹  
   -  Three-year rolling share of trading days in which U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar all fell: ~7.5%²  
   → Ratio: 61% ÷ 7.5% ≃ 8.1  

2. Relative volatility of unhedged ex-U.S. vs. U.S. domestic bonds  
   -  Over the past 20 years, an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio has been about 2× as volatile as a U.S. dollar–hedged domestic bond portfolio.³  

So in plain English:
- Investors are more than eight times as likely to expect further dollar weakness as the historical frequency of simultaneous “risk-off” days in U.S. markets.
- By contrast, the extra volatility you’d have taken on by holding an unhedged ex-U.S. bond portfolio is roughly twice that of a domestic bond portfolio over the same period.
