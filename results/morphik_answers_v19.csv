"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses temporal_analysis involving Palantir, quarter, growth.

1. Palantir’s Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024 YoY revenue growth rates (all per the Q1 2025 financial slides):  
   – Total revenue: +39% Y/Y  
   – Total revenue ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts: +44% Y/Y  
   – US revenue: +55% Y/Y  

2. Standard deviation across those three growth rates  
   – Rates: {39%, 44%, 55%}  
   – Mean = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46.0%  
   – Population σ = √[ ((39−46)² + (44−46)² + (55−46)²) / 3 ]  
              ≈ √[ (49 + 4 + 81) / 3 ]  
              ≈ √(44.67)  
              ≈ 6.7 percentage points  

3. Quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score (Q2 ’23 → Q1 ’25)  
   Rule of 40 by quarter:  
     Q2 2023 38% → Q3 2023 46% → Q4 2023 54% → Q1 2024 57% → Q2 2024 64% → Q3 2024 68% → Q4 2024 81% → Q1 2025 83%  

   QoQ changes (in p.p.): {+8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2}  

   – Mean change = 45 / 7 ≈ 6.43 p.p.  
   – Population σ = √[Σ(change–mean)² / 7]  
              ≈ √[85.71 / 7]  
              ≈ √12.24  
              ≈ 3.5 p.p.  

4. Interpretation relative to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 (83%)  
   – The ~6.7 p.p. dispersion in Y/Y revenue growth (39–55%) indicates that while Palantir’s growth pockets vary (US > total), they’re all clustered around mid-40s percent.  
   – The ~3.5 p.p. quarter-to-quarter volatility in the Rule of 40 underscores a generally smooth, upward trajectory (peaking at 83% in Q1 2025) despite occasional larger jumps (e.g., Q4 2024’s +13 p.p.).  
   – Together, these “volatility metrics” show that Palantir’s high Rule of 40 score in Q1 2025 rests on consistently strong revenue growth and steadily improving operating leverage, with only moderate fluctuation from one quarter to the next."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving Given Palantir, March, percentage.

**Answer:**  
Between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, Palantir’s operating expense **per US commercial customer** fell by approximately **23.0 %** year-over-year.

### 1. Key data inputs

1. **Revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts**  
   (from “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” appendix)  
   - Q1 2024: \$610,440 K  
   - Q1 2025: \$878,708 K  

2. **Adjusted operating income**  
   (from “Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income” appendix)  
   - Q1 2024: \$226,458 K  
   - Q1 2025: \$390,710 K  

3. **US commercial customer count**  
   (from “US Commercial Customer Count” slide)  
   - TTM ended Mar 31 2024: 262 customers  
   - TTM ended Mar 31 2025: 432 customers  

---

### 2. Compute total operating expense (adjusted basis)

Operating expense ≈ (Revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts) − (Adjusted operating income)

| Period    | Revenue excl. strat. (M \$) | Adj. op. income (M \$) | Operating expense (M \$) |
|:---------:|:---------------------------:|:----------------------:|:------------------------:|
| Q1 2024   | 610.440                     | 226.458                | 383.982                  |
| Q1 2025   | 878.708                     | 390.710                | 487.998                  |

- Q1 2024 expense = 610.440 − 226.458 = **\$383.982 M**  
- Q1 2025 expense = 878.708 − 390.710 = **\$487.998 M**  

---

### 3. Compute expense per US commercial customer

Operating expense per customer = (Total operating expense) ÷ (US commercial customer count)

| Period    | Expense (M \$) | Customers | Expense per customer (M \$) |
|:---------:|:--------------:|:---------:|:----------------------------:|
| Q1 2024   | 383.982        | 262       | 383.982 ÷ 262 = **1.4663**   |
| Q1 2025   | 487.998        | 432       | 487.998 ÷ 432 = **1.1296**   |

- Q1 2024: **\$1.4663 M** per customer  
- Q1 2025: **\$1.1296 M** per customer  

---

### 4. Year-over-year change

% Change = (New − Old) ÷ Old × 100

\[
\frac{1.1296 - 1.4663}{1.4663} \times 100 = -22.97\% \approx -23.0\%
\]

- **Operating expense per customer decreased by ≈ 23.0 % Y/Y**

---

**Context & Units:**  
All amounts are in millions of US dollars; customer counts reflect the trailing-twelve-months ended March 31 of each year. The calculation uses non-GAAP “adjusted operating income” and “revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts” as presented in Palantir’s Q1 2025 financial appendix.

"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving fiscal, quarter, January.

Here are the three answers, with a step‐by‐step reconciliation of the underlying figures:

1.  Change in Total Other Assets (Long-Term)  
    – As of January 26, 2025: $6,425 million  
    – As of April 27, 2025:   $6,788 million  
    – Change = $6,788 M – $6,425 M = **$363 million increase**  

2.  Increase in Assumed-Liability Acquisitions  
    (i.e. property, equipment and intangible assets acquired by assuming related liabilities)  
    – Q1 FY 2026: $408 million  
    – Q1 FY 2025: $147 million  
    – Increase = $408 M – $147 M = **$261 million**  

3.  Intangible-Asset Amortization as a Percentage of Q1 FY 2026 Acquisitions  
    – Amortization expense on intangible assets (Q1 FY 2026): $159 million  
    – Acquisitions by assumption (Q1 FY 2026):      $408 million  
    – Percentage = $159 M ÷ $408 M × 100 = 38.97% ≈ **39.0%**

"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving April, investment, By.

1. Fair value of CoreWeave investment (Apr 27, 2025)  
   – As disclosed in Note 5, the publicly-held equity securities line in the marketable-securities roll-forward includes CoreWeave.  The footnote states:  
     “The fair value of the investment as of April 27, 2025 was $1 billion…”  
     → FVCoreWeave = $1,000 million  

2. Carrying-value reclassification of non-marketable equity (Q1 FY 2026)  
   – From Note 6 (“Non-marketable Equity Securities”), the three-month adjustment schedule shows:  
     Reclassification(1)                        $(843) million  
     (This represents the carrying-value of CoreWeave moving out of long-term non-marketable equity into marketable securities.)  

3. Difference  
   – Amount by which fair value exceeds carrying-value reclassification:  
     = $1,000 million – $843 million  
     = $157 million  

Answer: The CoreWeave investment’s fair value of $1,000 million exceeded the $843 million carrying-value reclassification by $157 million.

"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving Palantir, Commercial Customer Count, rate.

Here’s the information you requested, all drawn directly from Palantir’s Q1 2025 Investor Presentation:

1.  The two percentages (under the “false premise” that 83 % = Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin + US Government Revenue Q/Q Growth)  
     • Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin (Q1 2025)    = 42 %  
        – Source: “Cash from Operations and Adjusted Free Cash Flow” chart shows Adjusted Free Cash Flow of \$370 M on \$884 M revenue, i.e. 42 % margin.  
          Calculation check: \$370 M / \$884 M ≈ 0.4186 → 42 %  
     • US Government Revenue Quarter-over-Quarter Growth (Q1 2025 vs Q4 2024)   = + 9 %  
        – Source: “Q1 2025 Highlights” bullet: “US government revenue grew + 45 % Y/Y and + 9 % Q/Q to \$373 million.”  

    Under that (incorrect) summation you would get 42 % + 9 % = 51 %, not 83 %.

2.  Quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities  
      = \$5.4 billion *and no debt*  
      – Source: “We ended Q1 2025 with \$5.4 B in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities and no debt.”

3.  Number of deals closed in Q1 2025 of at least \$1 million  
      = 139 deals  
      – Source: “Q1 2025 Highlights” bullet: “Closed 139 deals of at least \$1 million…”

4.  US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025  
      = 432 customers  
      – Source: “US Commercial Customer Count” TTM bar chart shows 432 at “TTM ended Mar 31, 2025” (a +65 % Y/Y and +13 % Q/Q increase).

—  
**Summary Table**  
• Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin (Q1 ’25)      = 42 %  
• US Government Revenue Q/Q Growth (Q1 ’25)      = + 9 %  
• Cash / Cash Equivalents / US Treasuries (Q1 ’25)  = \$5.4 B  
• Deals ≥ \$1 M closed (Q1 ’25)                 = 139  
• US Commercial Customers (TTM Mar 31 ’25)    = 432

"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving fiscal, quarter, Nvidia.

**Actual Year-over-Year Change in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities**  
From NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Three Months Ended):

| Period                 | Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (in $ millions) |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------:|
| Apr 28, 2024 (Q1 FY 2025) |                                             15,345      |
| Apr 27, 2025 (Q1 FY 2026) |                                             27,414      |

1. Compute the dollar change:  
   − Q1 FY 2026 net cash from operations  
     – Q1 FY 2025 net cash from operations  
   = 27,414 M − 15,345 M  
   = **+ 12,069 million**  

   Thus, rather than falling, operating cash flow **increased by $12.069 billion** year-over-year.

---

**Items Cited by Management as Driving the Increase**  
In the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of the Q1 FY 2026 Form 10-Q, NVIDIA’s management states:

> “Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, **due to higher revenue and timing of cash collections**.”  

Key drivers highlighted:  
• Higher revenue in Q1 FY 2026 (up 69% year-over-year to $44.062 billion)  
• Timing of cash collections from customers  

These factors—strong top-line growth and favorable collection timing—more than offset any headwinds and led to a $12.1 billion year-over-year increase in cash generated by operations.

"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving Palantir, rate, growth.

Here’s the step‐by‐step comparison of the two year‐over‐year (“Y/Y”) growth rates for Q1 2025, and the calculation of their difference:

1.  Overall Total Revenue Y/Y Growth  
    – Q1 2024 total revenue: \$634 million  
    – Q1 2025 total revenue: \$884 million  
    – Reported Y/Y growth:  
      (884 – 634) / 634 ≈ 0.3935 → **39.4%** (rounded and reported as +39% Y/Y)  
    ‒ Source: “Total revenue grew 39% Y/Y and 7% Q/Q to \$884 million.”  

2.  Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts Y/Y Growth  
    – Q1 2024 ex‐contracts revenue: \$610 million  
    – Q1 2025 ex‐contracts revenue: \$879 million  
    – Reported Y/Y growth:  
      (879 – 610) / 610 ≈ 0.4410 → **44.1%** (rounded and reported as +44% Y/Y)  
    ‒ Source: “Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts grew 44% Y/Y and 7% Q/Q.”  

3.  Difference in Y/Y Growth Rates  
    – 44.1% (ex‐contracts)  
    – 39.4% (overall)  
    – **Difference** = 44.1% – 39.4% ≈ **4.7 percentage points**, which rounds to **5.0 percentage points** when using the company’s presentation rounding.  

Answer: The Y/Y growth rate ex-strategic-commercial-contracts (+44%) exceeded the overall Y/Y growth rate (+39%) by approximately **5.0 percentage points**.

Here are the three requested figures, with all of the intermediate steps shown.  All figures are taken directly from NVIDIA’s Form 10-Q tables for the periods ended January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025.

1)  Standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value  
   by contractual maturity  
   ————————————————————————————————————————————————  
   From the “amortized cost and estimated fair value … by contractual maturity” table:

   •  Less than one year  
      – Jan 26, 2025 fair value = \$18,450 million  
      – Apr 27, 2025 fair value = \$25,781 million  
      – Change = 25,781 − 18,450 = \$ 7,331 million  

   •  Due in 1–5 years  
      – Jan 26, 2025 fair value = \$23,656 million  
      – Apr 27, 2025 fair value = \$26,355 million  
      – Change = 26,355 − 23,656 = \$ 2,699 million  

   •  Total  
      – Jan 26, 2025 fair value = \$42,106 million  
      – Apr 27, 2025 fair value = \$52,136 million  
      – Change = 52,136 − 42,106 = \$ 10,030 million  

   Let Δ = {7,331; 2,699; 10,030} (all in \$ million).  
   Step A: Compute the mean  
     mean(Δ) = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030)/3 = 20,060/3 ≈ 6,686.7 million  

   Step B: Compute each squared deviation  
     •  (7,331 − 6,686.7)² ≈ 644.3² ≈ 415,180  
     •  (2,699 − 6,686.7)² ≈ (−3,987.7)² ≈ 15,901,502  
     •  (10,030 − 6,686.7)² ≈ 3,343.3² ≈ 11,181,556  

   Step C: Sum of squares = 415,180 + 15,901,502 + 11,181,556 = 27,498,238  

   Step D: Population variance = 27,498,238 / 3 ≈ 9,166,079  
   Step E: Population standard deviation = √9,166,079 ≈ **\$ 3,027 million**  

   (If one preferred the sample standard deviation formula, dividing by 2 instead of 3, one would get ≈\$ 3,708 million, but the above uses the population formula.)

"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving Palantir, After, acceleration.

Here’s the step-by-step bridge of the two “accelerations” and their difference:

1. GAAP Net Income  
   • Q3 2024 → Q4 2024:  
     79.0 – 143.5 = – 64.5 million  
   • Q4 2024 → Q1 2025:  
     214.0 – 79.0 = + 135.0 million  
   • Acceleration (ΔQ4→Q1 minus ΔQ3→Q4):  
     135.0 – (– 64.5) = + 199.5 million  

2. GAAP Operating Income  
   • Q3 2024 → Q4 2024:  
     11.0 – 113.1 = – 102.1 million  
   • Q4 2024 → Q1 2025:  
     176.0 – 11.0 = + 165.0 million  
   • Acceleration (ΔQ4→Q1 minus ΔQ3→Q4):  
     165.0 – (– 102.1) = + 267.1 million  

3. Difference in Accelerations  
   267.1 million – 199.5 million = + 67.6 million  

**Answer:** The “bounce‐back” in GAAP operating income accelerated by about \$267 million versus a \$199.5 million swing in GAAP net income, so operating income’s acceleration exceeded net income’s by roughly **\$67.6 million**.

"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many percentage points did NVIDIA’s excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of its total accrued and other current liabilities change, and as of April 27, 2025, what percentage of its net long-term carrying amount of debt are its outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving April, change, Between January.

Below is a step-by-step calculation of the two ratios and the change in percentage points:

**1. Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of total accrued and other current liabilities**  
Source (Note 8 “Accrued and Other Current Liabilities”):  
- Apr 27, 2025  
  • Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$4,310 million  
  • Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$19,211 million  
- Jan 26, 2025  
  • Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$2,095 million  
  • Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$11,737 million  

Calculation:  
```
Apr 27, 2025 ratio  = 4,310 / 19,211 × 100  ≈ 22.43%  
Jan 26, 2025 ratio  = 2,095 / 11,737 × 100  ≈ 17.85%  
Change             = 22.43% – 17.85%          = 4.58 percentage points  
```

**2. Outstanding inventory purchase & long-term supply obligations as a percentage of net long-term carrying amount of debt**  
Sources:  
- Note 11 “Purchase Obligations”:  
  • Outstanding inventory purchase & long-term supply and capacity obligations = \$29.8 billion  
- Note 10 “Long-Term Debt”:  
  • Net long-term carrying amount of debt = \$8,464 million = \$8.464 billion  

Calculation:  
```
29.8 billion / 8.464 billion × 100  ≈ 352.1%  
```

**Answers:**  
- Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, NVIDIA’s excess inventory purchase obligations rose from 17.85% to 22.43% of its total accrued and other current liabilities, an increase of **4.58 percentage points**.  
- As of April 27, 2025, the \$29.8 billion of outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations represents **352.1%** of NVIDIA’s \$8.464 billion net long-term carrying amount of debt.

"For NVIDIA’s quarter ended April 27, 2025, what percentage of its remaining performance obligations for contracts greater than one year was unbilled, and for Palantir in Q1 2025, what percentage of its total remaining performance obligations was classified as long-term under its ASC 606 election?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving Palantir, quarter, performance.

Here are the two percentages, calculated step-by-step:

1. NVIDIA (Quarter ended April 27, 2025)  
   – From Note “Deferred Revenue” (p. 15 of the 10-Q):  
     • Remaining performance obligations (RPO) from contracts >1 year = \$1.8 billion  
     • Of this, \$160 million has not yet been billed (""unbilled"")  
   – Calculation:  
     • Unbilled ÷ Total RPO = \$160 M / \$1,800 M = 0.0888889  
     • As a percentage: 0.0888889 × 100 = 8.8889% ≈ **8.9%** unbilled  

   Breakdown  
   ```  
   Total RPO >1 year        = $1,800 M  
   Unbilled portion         =   160 M  
   ------------------------------------------------  
   Unbilled % of RPO        = 160 / 1,800 × 100 ≈ 8.9%  
   ```  

2. Palantir (Quarter ended March 31, 2025)  
   – From “Additional Metrics and Notes” (Appendix slide):  
     • Total RPO             = \$1.90 billion  
     • Long-Term RPO (contracts >12 months) = \$1.00 billion  
     • (Practical expedient election under ASC 606)  
   – Calculation:  
     • Long-Term ÷ Total RPO = \$1,000 M / \$1,900 M = 0.5263158  
     • As a percentage: 0.5263158 × 100 = 52.6316% ≈ **52.6%** long-term  

   Breakdown  
   ```  
   Total RPO               = $1,900 M  
   Long-Term RPO           = $1,000 M  
   ------------------------------------------------  
   Long-Term % of Total RPO = 1,000 / 1,900 × 100 ≈ 52.6%  
   ```  

— Therefore, for NVIDIA, **8.9%** of its >1 year RPO was unbilled at April 27, 2025, and for Palantir, **52.6%** of its total RPO as of Q1 2025 was classified as long-term under its ASC 606 election.

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving rate, fiscal, What.

Below is a step‐by‐step look at how NVIDIA’s on‐the‐books operating lease obligations evolved between fiscal 2026 and 2028, and how that historical growth compares to the company’s announced plan to take on roughly \$7.4 billion of new data‐center and office operating leases from Q2 FY 2026 through FY 2030.

1. Operating lease obligations by fiscal year (in millions)  
   From Note 14—Leases (abridged):  
   • FY 2026 (excl. Q1): \$ 274  
   • FY 2027: \$ 346  
   • FY 2028: \$ 349  

2. Year-over-year changes  
   – FY 2026→27:  
     \[(346 – 274) / 274\] = +72 / 274 ≈ +26.3%  
   – FY 2027→28:  
     \[(349 – 346) / 346\] = +3 / 346 ≈ + 0.9%  

   You can see that most of the growth occurs in the first year, then levels off.  

3. Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over two years  
   We take FY 2026 as the “start” value (274) and FY 2028 as the “end” value (349), with two full years between them:  

   CAGR  
   = \(\bigl(\tfrac{349}{274}\bigr)^{1/2}\;-\;1\)  
   = (1.2737)^(0.5) – 1  
   ≈ 1.1286 – 1  
   ≈ 0.1286, or **12.9% per annum**  

4. Quarter-over-quarter (Q-o-Q) lease expense growth in the most recent first quarter  
   From the same note:  
   – Q1 FY 2026 operating lease expense: \$101 million  
   – Q1 FY 2025 operating lease expense: \$ 80 million  
   – Q1 FY 2026 vs Q1 FY 2025:  
     (101 – 80) / 80 ≈ +26.3% year-over-year (no material “variable” or “short-term” amounts were reported).  

 (Note: we do not have a clean “quarter-over-quarter” change because the obligations schedule is on a fiscal-year basis, but the Q1 vs Q1 YOY lease expense growth roughly mirrors the FY 2026→27 jump in obligations.)

5. Forward commitment and strategic context  
   Immediately after listing the FY 2026–31 obligation schedule, NVIDIA discloses:  

   “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of \$7.4 billion, primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”

   In other words, although existing (“on-the-books”) obligations grew at about a 13% annual clip from FY 2026 to FY 2028 (and 26% in FY 2027 alone), the company is about to add an additional \$7.4 billion of commitments over the five-year span FY 2026 Q2 through FY 2030. That pipeline of new leasing will:

   • Plateau obligations in the early years (FY 2027–28) before the newly-started leases begin to stack up;  
   • Drive a fresh wave of growth in lease liabilities beyond FY 2028 (to meet exploding data-center capacity and office expansion needs);  
   • Produce a multiyear lease amortization profile (2–15.5 years) that will form the backbone of the long-term operating lease liability line in FY 2029–31.  

Putting it all together:  
• Existing operating leases grew from \$274 m to \$349 m in two years—roughly a 12.9% CAGR, with 26% growth in the first year and a stabilizing run-rate thereafter.  
• At the same time, Q1 FY 2026 lease expense jumped about 26% year-on-year.  
• NVIDIA’s plan to kick off \$7.4 billion of new data-center and office leases between Q2 FY 2026 and FY 2030 will dwarf that historical base, driving another leg of growth in the lease obligation schedule as those commitments hit the balance sheet over the coming years."

> **Interpretation:**  
> US commercial customer additions quarter-to-quarter are about 1.3 times as volatile as total customer additions, despite management’s strong 65% year-over-year expansion in the US commercial segment.

"After deploying Palantir Eval-Driven Automation in AIP as showcased in the DevCon 2 overview, by how much did Wendy's QSCC shorten its supply chain problem resolution cycle and how much did Heineken accelerate its solution build time?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving After, AIP, Wendy.

Here’s how those two dramatic turn-arounds stack up, in both absolute and relative terms:

1. Wendy’s QSCC: “From weeks (and days) to 5 minutes”  
   • Let’s pick a modest “weeks” figure—for example, 2 weeks (14 days) of investigation plus, say, 3 days to troubleshoot = 17 days total.  
   • 17 days × 24 hr/day × 60 min/hr = 24 480 minutes before automation  
   • 5 minutes after automation  
   • Time saved = 24 480 min – 5 min = 24 475 minutes  
   • Reduction as a %: (24 475 ÷ 24 480) × 100 ≈ 99.98% shorter  

   In other words, Wendy’s cut a ~17-day resolution cycle down to a 5-minute fix—over a 24 000-minute savings, or a 2,000× speed-up.  

2. Heineken: “In 3 months, the team built what used to take 3 years”  
   • Prior build time = 3 years = 36 months  
   • New build time = 3 months  
   • Time saved = 36 months – 3 months = 33 months  
   • Acceleration factor = 36 ÷ 3 = 12× faster  
   • Reduction as a %: (33 ÷ 36) × 100 ≈ 91.7% shorter  

   In plain English, Heineken went from a 36-month rollout to a 3-month rollout—cutting build time by 33 months (over 90% faster).

"Management asserted that Palantir delivered an 85% adjusted gross margin, sub-$450 million of adjusted expenses, and $220 million of net income attributable to common stockholders in Q1 2025; what do the reconciliation tables actually report for those three metrics?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving Management, Palantir, margin.

Below is a summary of what the appendix reconciliation tables actually show for Q1 2025 versus what Management cited in the front‐of‐deck.  All figures are in U.S. dollars.

1. Adjusted Gross Margin  
   Management said “85% adjusted gross margin.”  The reconciliation on slide …​ (Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit & Adjusted Gross Margin) reports:  
   - Revenue (from the “Additional Metrics” slide):  
     \$883,855 thousands (i.e. \$883.855 M)  
   - GAAP Gross Profit:  
     \$710,885 thousands (\$710.885 M)  
   - Plus Stock-Based Compensation in Cost of Revenue:  
     \$15,016 thousands  
   → Adjusted Gross Profit = \$710,885 + 15,016 = \$725,901 thousands  
   → Adjusted Gross Margin = \$725,901 / \$883,855 = 82.1%  
   The table itself rounds this to 82%, not 85%.

2. Adjusted Expenses  
   Management said “sub-\$450 million of adjusted expenses.”  The reconciliation on slide …​ (Reconciliation of Cost of Revenue and Total Operating Expenses to Adjusted Expenses) shows:  
   - Total Operating Expenses:  
     \$707,807 thousands (\$707.807 M)  
   - Less Stock-Based Compensation:  
     \$155,339 thousands  
   - Less Employer Payroll Taxes Related to Stock-Based Compensation:  
     \$59,323 thousands  
   → Adjusted Expenses = \$707,807 – 155,339 – 59,323 = \$493,145 thousands  
   That is \$493.1 M of adjusted expenses, well above \$450 M.

3. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders  
   Management cited “\$220 million of net income attributable to common stockholders.”  From slide …​ (Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings Per Share, Diluted to Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Diluted):  
   - Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (GAAP):  
     \$214,031 thousands (\$214.0 M)  
   - (Separately, “Adjusted Net Income” after adding back stock-comp and tax effects is \$334.405 M.)  
   The table reports a GAAP net income of \$214 M, not \$220 M.

—  
In addition, for context:  
• GAAP Gross Margin = \$710.885 M / \$883.855 M = 80.4%  
• GAAP Operating Income = \$176.048 M ⇒ 176.048 / 883.855 = 19.9% GAAP operating margin (the slide rounds to 20%)  
• Adjusted Operating Income = \$390.710 M ⇒ 44.2% adjusted operating margin (rounded to 44%)  
• GAAP Net Margin = \$214.031 M / \$883.855 M = 24.2%  
• Adjusted Net Margin = \$334.405 M / \$883.855 M = 37.8%.

                   = \$8,500 million  

3. Compute UDDIC as a percentage of total principal at each date  
   a) January 26, 2025  
      37 / 8,500 × 100 = 0.4353%  
   b) April 27, 2025  
      36 / 8,500 × 100 = 0.4235%  

4. Calculate the change (April 27 minus January 26)  
   0.4235% − 0.4353% = −0.0118 percentage points  

Rounded to two decimal places, the UDDIC ratio moved from 0.44% to 0.42%, a decline of 0.01 percentage point (approximately 1.2 basis points).

"In the three months ended April 27, 2025, what percentage of Nvidia’s consolidated Operating income was absorbed by the All Other category’s Stock-based compensation expense and what percentage of the Compute & Networking segment’s Revenue was consumed by its Other segment items?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving All Other, Nvidia, In.

Below are the two percentages for the three-months ended April 27, 2025, together with the detailed calculation steps:

1) All Other Stock-based Compensation as a % of Consolidated Operating Income  
2) Compute & Networking “Other segment items” as a % of Compute & Networking Revenue  

---

## 1) All Other Stock-based Compensation ÷ Consolidated Operating Income

| Item                                       | Amount (in $ millions) |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Consolidated Operating Income (total)      | 21 638 ¹               |
| “All Other” Stock-based Compensation       |  1 474 ²               |

Calculation:  
\[
\frac{\textrm{All Other Stock-based Comp}}{\textrm{Consolidated Operating Income}}
= \frac{1\,474}{21\,638}
= 0.06810 \approx 6.81\%
\]

→ **6.81 %** of Nvidia’s consolidated operating income was absorbed by the All Other category’s stock-based compensation expense.

Sources:  
¹ Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income, Operating income = \$21,638 million  
² Note 13 (reconciling items in “All Other”), Stock-based compensation expense = \$1,474 million  

---

## 2) Compute & Networking “Other segment items” ÷ Compute & Networking Revenue

| Item                                  | Amount (in $ millions) |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Compute & Networking Revenue          | 39 589 ³               |
| Compute & Networking Other segment items | 17 535 ³               |

Calculation:  
\[
\frac{\textrm{Other segment items (C&N)}}{\textrm{C&N Revenue}}
= \frac{17\,535}{39\,589}
= 0.4428 \approx 44.28\%
\]

→ **44.28 %** of the Compute & Networking segment’s revenue was consumed by its “Other segment items.”

Source:  
³ Note 13 segment table – Compute & Networking segment revenue = \$39,589 million; other segment items = \$17,535 million

### Summary

- All Other stock-based compensation absorbed **6.81 %** of consolidated operating income.  
- Compute & Networking “Other segment items” consumed **44.28 %** of that segment’s revenue.

"In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, what was NVIDIA's interest coverage ratio (interest income divided by interest expense) and what percentage of its net interest spread did net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities—driven by fair value volatility in investments including CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.—consume?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving quarter, fiscal, In.

**Answer Summary**  
In Q1 FY 2026 (three months ended April 27, 2025), NVIDIA’s  
1. Interest coverage ratio (interest income ÷ interest expense) was approximately **8.2×** (or 817%).  
2. Net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities ($222 million) consumed about **49.1%** of its net interest spread.

---

### 1. Interest Coverage Ratio  
From NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Three Months Ended Apr 27, 2025):  
- Interest income = $515 million  
- Interest expense = $63 million  

**Calculation:**  
1. Compute the coverage ratio as:  
   \[ Interest Coverage Ratio = \frac{Interest Income}{Interest Expense} \]  
2. Substitute the amounts:  
   \[ = \frac{515}{63} = 8.1746… \]  

**Result:**  
- ≈ 8.17×, which is commonly rounded to **8.2×**  
- Alternatively expressed in percentage terms: 8.1746 × 100 % = 817%  

> “Interest coverage ratio” of 8.2× means NVIDIA earned 8.2 dollars of interest income for each dollar of interest expense.  

---

### 2. % of Net Interest Spread Consumed by Net Unrealized Losses  
**Definitions & amounts**  
- **Net interest spread** = Interest income – Interest expense  
  = $515 million – $63 million = $452 million  
- **Net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities**  
  From Note 5 (Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities):  
  “Net unrealized losses on investments in publicly-held equity securities held at period end were $222 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.”  

**Calculation:**  
1. Net interest spread:  
   \[ 515 – 63 = 452\;(\$ million) \]  
2. Percentage consumed by the $222 million loss:  
   \[ \frac{222}{452} \times 100\% = 49.12\% \]  

**Result:**  
- Approximately **49.1%** of the net interest spread was consumed by net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities.  

> In other words, roughly half of NVIDIA’s net interest “profit” was offset by fair-value volatility in its publicly-held equity investments (notably CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.).

"In Q1 2025, by how many percentage points does the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue, and by how many percentage points lower is that excess than the spread between US commercial and US government revenue growth rates?","1. In Q1 2025, total revenue (ex‐SCC) grew 44% Y/Y versus 39% Y/Y for total revenue—an excess of  
   **44% − 39% = 5 percentage points**.  
2. Over the same period, US commercial grew 71% Y/Y while US government grew 45% Y/Y, for a spread of  
   **71% − 45% = 26 percentage points**.  
3. The 5 pp excess is therefore **21 pp lower** than the 26 pp US-commercial vs. US-government spread.  

— Total excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts: +44% Y/Y  
— Total revenue: +39% Y/Y  
— US commercial: +71% Y/Y  
— US government: +45% Y/Y"
"What is the ratio of the U.S. dollar's share of global central bank foreign exchange reserves in 2024 to the euro's share of SWIFT settlements, and by how many percentage points does the dollar's share of SWIFT trade finance settlements exceed its share of international debt?","Here are the numbers drawn directly from the discussion on “Is this the downfall of the U.S. dollar?”:

- U.S. dollar’s share of global central-bank FX reserves (2024): 60%  
- Euro’s share of SWIFT settlements: 6%  

→ Ratio (USD‐reserves : EUR‐SWIFT) = 60 / 6 = 10 : 1  

- U.S. dollar’s share of SWIFT trade-finance settlements: ~85%  
- U.S. dollar’s share of international debt: 65%  

→ Difference = 85% − 65% = 20 percentage points"
"Between the first quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2026, by how many basis points did NVIDIA’s operating lease cash flow conversion ratio—calculated as operating cash flow used for operating leases divided by operating lease expense—change?","Below is the calculation of the operating-lease cash-flow conversion ratio for each quarter and the change in basis points (bps):

| Quarter ended  | Cash flow used for OLs | OL expense | Ratio (%)     |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Apr 27, 2025¹  | \$96 million           | \$101 million  | 96/101 ≈ 95.1% |
| Apr 28, 2024²  | \$69 million           | \$80 million   | 69/80  = 86.3% |

Change in ratio = 95.1% – 86.3% = 8.8 percentage points = **880 basis points**.

¹ Three months ended Apr 27, 2025, operating cash flow used for operating leases of \$96 million and operating lease expense of \$101 million (Note 14)

"According to Nvidia’s cash flow statement, when it was incorrectly claimed that net cash used in investing activities exceeded share repurchases for the period, what were the actual figures for net cash used in investing activities versus share repurchases and how did dividends paid compare to payments for employee stock plan taxes?","For the quarter ended April 27, 2025 (first quarter of fiscal 2026), the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows shows:  

- Net cash used in investing activities: $5,216 million  
- Payments related to repurchases of common stock: $14,095 million  

In other words, share buy-backs more than doubled the cash consumed by investing.  

In the same period, dividends paid were $244 million, versus $1,532 million paid for employee stock-plan tax withholdings. Thus, dividends were only about one-sixth of the cash outlay for stock-plan tax payments.

"On a quarter-over-quarter basis, by how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s net working capital change, by how many millions of dollars did its retained earnings increase, and what percentage of that retained earnings increase was consumed by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets?","**Answer:** 

- **Net working capital** (current assets – current liabilities) rose from  
  $80,126 M – $18,047 M = $62,079 M (Jan 26, 2025)  
  to  
  $89,935 M – $26,542 M = $63,393 M (Apr 27, 2025),  
  an increase of **$1,314 million**.¹

- **Retained earnings** increased from $68,038 M (Jan 26, 2025) to $72,158 M (Apr 27, 2025),  
  an increase of **$4,120 million**.²

- **Purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets** during the quarter totaled $1,227 M of cash outflows,³ which represents  
  1,227 / 4,120 ≈ 0.298 ≈ **29.8%** of the $4,120 M increase in retained earnings.

"Under footnote 11 in J.P. Morgan’s midyear report article “IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?” what is the difference in percentage points between the net percentage of investors expecting continued dollar depreciation and the year-to-date share of trading days in 2025 with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar as defined by the market-credibility metric in the “Tracking the market’s perception of the dollar” section?","The report cites a net 61% of investors expecting further dollar depreciation (footnote 11) versus only 5% of trading days in 2025 seeing simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar.  

61% − 5% = 56 percentage points difference."
"In Q1 FY26, following the USG’s April 9, 2025 export licensing requirements that diminished demand for H20 products, what percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales did NVIDIA’s related excess inventory charge represent, and by how many percentage points did that percentage exceed Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin?","In Q1 of fiscal ’26 NVIDIA took a $4.5 billion H20‐related excess-inventory charge versus $4.6 billion of pre-license H20 sales – i.e. about 4.5/4.6 ≈ 97.8% of those prior sales.  Even if you round up to 98%, that still blows past Palantir’s own Q1 2025 non-GAAP (i.e. “adjusted”) operating-income margin (42%) by roughly 56 percentage points.  

**How we get there**  
 ­ NVIDIA H20 charge ÷ H20 pre‐license sales = 4.5 ÷ 4.6 ≈ 0.978 → 97.8% ≈ 98%  
 ­ Palantir Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin (per its investor-deck) = 42%  
 ­ Difference = 98% − 42% ≈ 56 percentage points

"What is the full applicability date of the EU AI Act, what licensing requirement and compliance deadline would the US government's ""AI Diffusion"" IFR have imposed on NVIDIA's H200 and GB200 data center products, and which NVIDIA product category would the USG's ""Connected Vehicle"" import restrictions affect?","1. EU AI Act full applicability date  
   The EU AI Act “became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period.”  In other words, **it will be fully in force on August 1, 2026** (see Risk Factors, p. 33).

2. “AI Diffusion” IFR licensing requirement & deadline  
   As proposed on January 15, 2025, the “AI Diffusion” Interim Final Rule would have:
   - Imposed a **worldwide export licensing requirement** on all items controlled under ECCNs 3A090.a, 4A090.a or the corresponding “.Z” entries (including firmware, software and tech).  
   - Applied that licensing mandate to NVIDIA’s leading data-center GPUs—**H200 and GB200**.  
   - Taken effect **120 days after publication** (i.e. by mid-May 2025).

3. “Connected Vehicle” import restrictions – affected product category  
   The U.S. government’s proposed “Connected Vehicle” import controls target **automotive products**—in NVIDIA’s case, its **Automotive segment** (e.g. self-driving platforms and related in-vehicle solutions)."
"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","The three-year rolling share of U.S. trading days in which stocks, bonds and the dollar all fell is roughly 7.5% (Exhibit “Tracking the market’s perception of the dollar,” p. 22).  At the same time, a net 61% of investors now say they expect further dollar depreciation (p. 21).  

-  Ratio of investor-expectations to “three-asset” down-days  
   = 61% ÷ 7.5% ≈ 8.1  

By contrast, over the past 20 years an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio has exhibited about twice the volatility of a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio (p. 21).  

– In other words, investor pessimism about the dollar (≈8 to 1) is roughly four times larger than the volatility differential (2 to 1) between unhedged ex-U.S. and U.S.-dollar bond portfolios."
