## 1. Year-over-Year Revenue Growth Rates

From the Q1 2025 Highlights and financial slides we have:

1. **Total Revenue**  
   Q1 2024 → Q1 2025  
   Growth = +39% Y/Y  

2. **Total Revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts**  
   Q1 2024 → Q1 2025  
   Growth = +44% Y/Y  

3. **US Revenue**  
   Q1 2024 → Q1 2025  
   Growth = +55% Y/Y  

Let’s denote these three rates as  
r₁ = 39%, r₂ = 44%, r₃ = 55%.

### 1.1 Mean of the Three Y/Y Rates
mean = (39% + 44% + 55%) / 3  
  = 138% / 3  
  = 46.0%

### 1.2 Deviations from the Mean
- d₁ = 39% – 46.0% = –7.0%  
- d₂ = 44% – 46.0% = –2.0%  
- d₃ = 55% – 46.0% = +9.0%

### 1.3 Squared Deviations
- d₁² = (–7.0%)² = 49.0  
- d₂² = (–2.0%)² = 4.0  
- d₃² = ( +9.0%)² = 81.0  

Sum of squares = 49.0 + 4.0 + 81.0 = 134.0

### 1.4 Variance & Standard Deviation
We treat these three rates as the entire “population” of interest:

variance = (134.0) / 3  
   = 44.666…

σ = √(44.666…) ≈ 6.68 percentage points

**Answer:** The standard deviation across the three Y/Y growth rates is **≈ 6.7 pp**.

## 2. Quarter-over-Quarter Changes in the Rule of 40

From the appendix slide “Reconciliation of Rule of 40”:

Quarter   Rule of 40  
Q2 2023   38%  
Q3 2023   46%  
Q4 2023   54%  
Q1 2024   57%  
Q2 2024   64%  
Q3 2024   68%  
Q4 2024   81%  
Q1 2025   83%  

We compute the Q/Q differences for the seven intervals:

| From → To    | Change (pp) |
|--------------|-------------|
| Q2 → Q3 2023 | 46 – 38   = +8 |
| Q3 → Q4 2023 | 54 – 46   = +8 |
| Q4 → Q1 2024 | 57 – 54   = +3 |
| Q1 → Q2 2024 | 64 – 57   = +7 |
| Q2 → Q3 2024 | 68 – 64   = +4 |
| Q3 → Q4 2024 | 81 – 68   = +13|
| Q4 → Q1 2025 | 83 – 81   = +2 |

Sequence of changes: [8, 8, 3, 7, 4, 13, 2]

### 2.1 Mean of the Seven Q/Q Changes
mean = (8 + 8 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 13 + 2) / 7  
  = 45 / 7  
  ≈ 6.4286 pp

### 2.2 Deviations & Squared Deviations

| Change xᵢ | xᵢ – mean | (xᵢ – mean)² |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
|  8        |  +1.5714  | 2.469        |
|  8        |  +1.5714  | 2.469        |
|  3        |  –3.4286  | 11.755       |
|  7        |  +0.5714  | 0.327        |
|  4        |  –2.4286  | 5.901        |
| 13        |  +6.5714  | 43.185       |
|  2        |  –4.4286  | 19.610       |
| **Total** |           | **85.716**   |

### 2.3 Variance & Standard Deviation
variance = (85.716) / 7  
   = 12.245

σ = √(12.245) ≈ 3.50 pp

**Answer:** The standard deviation of the Q/Q Rule-of-40 changes is **≈ 3.5 pp**.

## 3. Relating the Volatility Metrics to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40

- In Q1 2025 the Rule of 40 reached **83%**, a very strong result (more than double the nominal 40% “benchmark”).  
- The quarter-over-quarter changes have a **σ ≈ 3.5 pp**, meaning the pace of Rule-of-40 improvement has been relatively steady (with typical quarter-to-quarter swings of ±3–4 pp around a ~6.4 pp average increase).  
- Likewise, the three Y/Y revenue growth rates exhibit a **σ ≈ 6.7 pp**, showing that while growth rates (total vs. ex-contracts vs. US) differ, they cluster within ±7 pp of their ~46% average.  

Taken together:
- **High & consistent growth** (σ ~6.7 pp Y/Y)  
- **Steady margin-plus-growth acceleration** (σ ~3.5 pp Q/Q in Rule of 40)  
…have driven the **83%** Rule of 40 in Q1 2025, underscoring both robust performance and relatively low volatility around that upswing."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving March, percentage, change.

Below is a step-by-step reconciliation showing how we arrive at the year-over-year change in operating expense per U.S. commercial customer between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025:

**1. Pull the underlying numbers**  
• Revenue Excl​. Strategic Commercial Contracts (from “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” appendix)  
  – Q1 2024:  
    – Total Revenue: \$634,338   
    – Less Strategic Commercial: \$23,898   
    → Net = \$634,338 – \$23,898 = \$610,440 (thousands) = \$610.440 M  
  – Q1 2025:  
    – Total Revenue: \$883,855   
    – Less Strategic Commercial: \$5,147   
    → Net = \$883,855 – \$5,147 = \$878,708 (thousands) = \$878.708 M  

• Adjusted Operating Income (from “Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income” appendix)  
  – Q1 2024: \$226,458 (thousands) = \$226.458 M  
  – Q1 2025: \$390,710 (thousands) = \$390.710 M  

• U.S. Commercial Customer Count (TTM ended Mar 31)  
  – Q1 2024: 262 customers  
  – Q1 2025: 432 customers  

**2. Compute Adjusted Operating Expense**  
Adjusted Operating Expense ≡ (Net Revenue Ex-Strategic) – (Adjusted Op Income)  

• Q1 2024  
  – \$610.440 M – \$226.458 M = \$383.982 M  

• Q1 2025  
  – \$878.708 M – \$390.710 M = \$487.998 M  

**3. Convert to Per-Customer Expense**  
Per-Customer Expense ≡ Adjusted Operating Expense ÷ U.S. Commercial Customer Count  

• Q1 2024  
  – \$383.982 M ÷ 262 = \$1.4658 M per customer  

• Q1 2025  
  – \$487.998 M ÷ 432 = \$1.1296 M per customer  

**4. Calculate Year-Over-Year Change**  
% Change = (New – Old) ÷ Old  

= (\$1.1296 M – \$1.4658 M) ÷ \$1.4658 M  
≈ –\$0.3362 M ÷ \$1.4658 M  
≈ –0.2295 → –22.95%  

**Answer:**  
Operating expense per U.S. commercial customer fell from \$1.4658 million in Q1 2024 to \$1.1296 million in Q1 2025, a **22.95% decrease** year-over-year.

"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving percentage, change, By.

Below is the step-by-step calculation:

**1. Change in Total Other Assets**  
From the Condensed Balance Sheet (Note 8 – “Other Assets (Long Term)”):  
- As of January 26, 2025: Total other assets = \$ 6,425 million  
- As of April 27, 2025: Total other assets = \$ 6,788 million  

Change = 6,788 – 6,425 = **\$ 363 million (increase)**  

**2. Increase in Assumed-Liability Acquisitions**  
From Note “Property and Equipment” (Note ?):  
- Q1 FY 2026 assumed-liability acquisitions = \$ 408 million  
- Q1 FY 2025 assumed-liability acquisitions = \$ 147 million  

Increase = 408 – 147 = **\$ 261 million**  

**3. Amortization Expense as a % of Q1 FY 2026 Acquisitions**  
From Note 7 – “Amortizable Intangible Assets and Goodwill”:  
- Q1 FY 2026 intangible-asset amortization expense = \$ 159 million  

Percentage = (159 ÷ 408) × 100 = 0.3897 × 100 ≈ **38.97 %**  

Rounded to one decimal place: **39.0 %**  

—  
Summary:  
- Total other assets rose by \$ 363 million between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025.  
- Assumed-liability acquisitions increased by \$ 261 million year-over-year for Q1 (FY 2026 vs FY 2025).  
- First-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense represented 38.97 % (≈ 39.0 %) of the \$ 408 million Q1 FY 2026 acquisitions.

"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving April, By, investment.

**Answer: ** By $157 million.

**Calculation Details**  
1. Fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025  
 – As disclosed in Note 5 (Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities), “The fair value of the investment as of April 27, 2025 was $ 1 billion…”  
 → $ 1 billion = $ 1,000 million  

2. Carrying value reclassification adjustment in Q1 FY26  
 – From Note 6 (Non-marketable Equity Securities), the “Reclassification (1)” line for the three months ended April 27, 2025 shows a reclassification of $(843) million.  
 → Adjustment = $ 843 million  

3. Difference (excess of fair value over reclassification adjustment)  
 = $ 1,000 million – $ 843 million  
 = $ 157 million  

**Conclusion:**  
The fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceeded the carrying-value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in Q1 FY26 by **$ 157 million**."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving Treasury, March, margin.

Below is the answer under the (incorrect) assumption that Palantir’s 83% Rule of 40 score for Q1 2025 was calculated as:

 Rule of 40 = (Adjusted free cash-flow margin) + (US Government revenue QoQ growth)

---

1) Adjusted free cash-flow margin  
   - 42%  
     - Source: “Cash from Operations and Adjusted Free Cash Flow” chart (Q1 2025 Adjusted FCF Margin = 42%).

2) US Government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth  
   - +9% QoQ  
     - Source: “Q1 2025 Highlights” & “US Government Revenue Growth” chart (US government revenue grew +9% Q/Q to $373 M).

3) Quarter-end balance of cash, cash equivalents and US Treasury securities  
   - $5.4 billion  
     - “We ended Q1 2025 with $5.4 B in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities and no debt.”

4) Number of deals ≥ $1 million closed in Q1 2025  
   - 139 deals  
     - “During Q1 2025, we closed 139 deals of at least $1 million.”

5) US Commercial Customer Count (TTM ended March 31, 2025)  
   - 432 customers  
     - From “US Commercial Customer Count” (TTM ended Mar 31 2025 = 432; +65% Y/Y, +13% Q/Q).

—  
Note (step-by-step “calculation” under this premise):  
 • Adjusted free cash-flow margin = 42%  
 • US Government revenue Q/Q growth = 9%  
 → Sum = 42% + 9% = 51% (which obviously does **not** equal 83%, illustrating why that premise is false).

## 2. Compute Year-over-Year Growth Rates  

1. Metric 1 (A + B):
   
   Growth = (2,085 − 1,421) / 1,421  
           = 664 / 1,421  
           = 0.4674 ⇒ **46.7%**  

2. Metric 2 (C + D):
   
   Growth = ( 411 − 242 ) / 242  
           = 169 / 242  
           = 0.698 ⇒ **69.8%**

"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving percentage, rate, growth.

Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Identify the year-over-year growth rates**  
   From the Q1 2025 slide deck:  
   - Total revenue (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025) grew **+39% Y/Y**  
   - Revenue *excluding* strategic commercial contracts (same periods) grew **+44% Y/Y**

2. **Convert to the same precision**  
   - Total revenue: 39.3% (actually \[(\$884 – \$634)/\$634≈0.393\])  
   - Ex-strategic revenue: 44.0% (actually \[(\$879 – \$610)/\$610≈0.440\])

3. **Compute the difference in percentage-points**  
   44.0% (ex-strategic)  
 – 39.3% (overall)  
 =  ** 4.7 percentage points**

4. **Round to whole-number percentage-points (as presented)**  
   44% – 39% = **5 percentage points**

Here are the detailed answers to your three‐part question:

1. Standard deviation of the quarter-to-quarter changes in estimated fair value  
   — We start with the fair-value balances by contractual maturity at January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025 (in millions):  

   | Maturity        | Jan 26 2025 FV | Apr 27 2025 FV | Change (∆FV) |
   |-----------------|---------------:|--------------:|-------------:|
   | Less than 1 year|        18,450  |       25,781  |       7,331  |
   | 1–5 years       |        23,656  |       26,355  |       2,699  |
   | Total           |        42,106  |       52,136  |      10,030  |

   1. Compute the three ∆FV values:
      – Less than 1 year: 25,781 − 18,450 = 7,331  
      – 1–5 years:        26,355 − 23,656 = 2,699  
      – Total:           52,136 − 42,106 = 10,030  

   2. Find the mean change:  
      mean = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030) / 3 ≈ 6,687  

   3. Compute squared deviations:  
      – (7,331 − 6,687)² = 644² ≈ 415,000  
      – (2,699 − 6,687)² = (−3,988)² ≈ 15,900,000  
      – (10,030 − 6,687)² = 3,343² ≈ 11,180,000  

      Sum of squares ≈ 27,495,000  

   4. Divide by 3 (population variance) and take the square root:  
      σ ≈ √(27,495,000 / 3) ≈ √9,165,000 ≈ 3,028  

   → **σ ≈ 3,028 million** (i.e. ~$3.03 billion)

     • Amortized cost: \$18,504 million  
     • Unrealized gain: \$     51 million  
     • Unrealized loss: \$    (29 million)  

   → **Unrealized gain = \$51 million**  

3. Percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value  
   From the Level 1 “Money market funds” line in the fair-value hierarchy table (Note 6):  

   | Date             | Level 1 MMF FV |
   |------------------|--------------:|
   | Jan 26, 2025     |     \$ 3,760 M |
   | Apr 27, 2025     |     \$ 6,522 M |

   – Absolute increase = 6,522 − 3,760 = 2,762 million  
   – Percent increase = (2,762 / 3,760) × 100 ≈ 73.4%  

   → **Level 1 money market funds rose ≈ 73.4%** between January 26 and April 27, 2025.

Context note: As the Company explains, its gross unrealized losses on fixed-income securities were driven “primarily by changes in interest rates,” which is reflected in the shifts in fair values shown above.

**1. Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a % of total accrued and other current liabilities**  

From the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet components (Note 8):  

─ As of April 27, 2025  
• Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$ 4,310 million  
• Total accrued and other current liabilities = \$ 19,211 million

"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving March, Between, percentage.

Here’s how you can arrive at the non-U.S. customer adds and their share of the total global commercial customer growth between the TTM periods ending March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025:

## 1. Underlying data

1. Global Commercial Customer Count (TTM)  
   • Mar 31 2024: 427  
   • Mar 31 2025: 622  

2. U.S. Commercial Customer Count (TTM)  
   • Mar 31 2024: 262  
   • Mar 31 2025: 432  

*(All figures are number of customers.)*

## 2. Derive Non-U.S. counts

Non-U.S. = (Global – U.S.)

• At Mar 31 2024:  
  Non-U.S._24 = 427 – 262 = 165  

• At Mar 31 2025:  
  Non-U.S._25 = 622 – 432 = 190  

## 3. Compute absolute adds

1. Global net adds:  
   ΔGlobal = 622 – 427 = 195  

2. Non-U.S. net adds:  
   ΔNon-U.S. = 190 – 165 = 25  

## 4. Share of total growth

Percentage that non-U.S. adds represent of total global adds:

\[
\frac{\Delta \text{Non-U.S.}}{\Delta \text{Global}} \times 100
=
\frac{25}{195}\times 100
\approx 12.82\%
\]

Rounded to one decimal place: **12.8 %**.

**Answer:**  
Between the TTM periods ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, Palantir added **25 non-U.S. commercial customers**, which accounted for **12.8 %** of its **195** total global commercial net customer adds."
"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving rate, growth, fiscal.

Below is a step-by-step “walk‐through” of the operating-lease obligation figures from Note 14, followed by a short discussion of how they tie back to the company’s plan to begin roughly \$7.4 billion of new data-center and office leases between Q2 FY 2026 and FY 2030.

1.  Extract the annual obligation lines (in millions) from Note 14:  

    | Fiscal year      | Future minimum lease obligations |  
    |------------------|-----------------------------------|  
    | 2026 (excl. Q1)  | \$ 274                            |  
    | 2027             | \$ 346                            |  
    | 2028             | \$ 349                            |  
    | …                | …                                 |  

2.  Compute year-over-year changes:  

    •  2027 vs. 2026:  
       \[(346 – 274) / 274\] × 100 = 26.3 %  

    •  2028 vs. 2027:  
       \[(349 – 346) / 346\] × 100 = 0.87 %  

3.  Compute the two-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from FY 2026 to FY 2028:  

    CAGR = \(\bigl(\tfrac{\text{Ending}}{\text{Beginning}}\bigr)^{1/n}\;–\;1\),  
    where  
    ‑ Beginning = 274 (FY 2026),  
    ‑ Ending = 349 (FY 2028),  
    ‑ n = 2 years.  

    1)  Ending/Beginning = 349/274 = 1.2737  
    2)  (1.2737)^(1/2) = 1.1278  
    3)  1.1278 – 1 = 0.1278 ⇒ **12.8 % p.a.**  

4.  (As a reference point) Quarter-over-quarter movement in long-term lease liabilities on the face of the balance sheet (April 27 vs. January 26, 2025):  

    •  Jan 26 ’25: \$ 1,519 M  
    •  Apr 27 ’25: \$ 1,521 M  
    •  Q-on-Q change = (1,521 – 1,519)/1,519 ≈ 0.13 %  

—  

**Putting it into context**  
In the same footnote (Note 14), NVIDIA states that “between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of \$7.4 billion, primarily for data center and office operating leases.”  

–  The **12.8 % CAGR** calculated above reflects only the existing pipeline of non–cancelable commitments as of April 27, 2025, rising from \$274 M in FY 2026 to \$349 M in FY 2028.  
–  That growth is front-loaded (a 26 % jump in FY 2027, then flattening in FY 2028), mirroring the initial ramp of new data-center/office leases coming on line in Q2 FY 2026.  
–  Going forward, the planned \$7.4 billion of new commitments (averaging nearly \$1.5 billion per year over five years) will dwarf the \$300 – \$350 million run-rate shown in FY 2027/28 and drive a much steeper obligation curve beyond FY 2028.  

In short, the ~13 % historical CAGR through FY 2028 captures the first wave of lease commencements; once the full \$7.4 billion program is in flight through FY 2030, we would expect annual obligation growth to accelerate well above that ~12.8 % baseline."
"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses temporal_analysis involving March, ratio, growth.

Below is a step-by-step calculation of the quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth-rate volatilities for (a) U.S. commercial customers and (b) all customers, followed by the ratio of those volatilities and a brief interpretation.

**1. Extract QoQ growth rates**  
Sources:  
– Slide “US Commercial Customer Count” (TTM Q-ends Mar 31 ’24 → Jun 30 ’24 → Sep 30 ’24 → Dec 31 ’24 → Mar 31 ’25)  
– Slide “Customer Count” (same TTM quarters for total customers)

  A. U.S. Commercial Customer Count  
   - 262 → 295 : +13%  
   - 295 → 321 : +9%  
   - 321 → 382 : +19%  
   - 382 → 432 : +13%  
   ⇒ Growth vector g₁ = [13, 9, 19, 13] (%)

  B. Total Customer Count  
   - 554 → 593 : +7%  
   - 593 → 629 : +6%  
   - 629 → 711 : +13%  
   - 711 → 769 : +8%  
   ⇒ Growth vector g₂ = [7, 6, 13, 8] (%)

**2. Compute the standard deviation of each vector**  
We’ll treat these four observations as a population for simplicity:

  A. Commercial  
   - Mean μ₁ = (13 + 9 + 19 + 13)/4 = 13.5  
   - Deviations: [–0.5, –4.5, +5.5, –0.5]  
   - Squared deviations: [0.25, 20.25, 30.25, 0.25] → sum = 51  
   - Variance σ₁² = 51/4 = 12.75  
   - σ₁ = √12.75 ≈ 3.57%

  B. Total  
   - Mean μ₂ = (7 + 6 + 13 + 8)/4 = 8.5  
   - Deviations: [–1.5, –2.5, +4.5, –0.5]  
   - Squared deviations: [2.25, 6.25, 20.25, 0.25] → sum = 29  
   - Variance σ₂² = 29/4 = 7.25  
   - σ₂ = √7.25 ≈ 2.69%

**3. Volatility ratio**  
  Ratio = σ₁ / σ₂ ≈ 3.57% / 2.69% ≈ 1.33

**4. Interpretation**  
A ratio of ~1.3 means that quarter-to-quarter growth in U.S. commercial customer count is about 30% more “bumpy” (higher standard deviation) than overall customer-count growth. In other words, although management touts a smooth-looking +65% Y/Y increase in U.S. commercial customers, the underlying quarterly adds fluctuate more widely than the total customer base, reflecting greater short-term volatility in that segment."

1. **Interest Income Increase**  
   – Q1 FY 2026: \$515 M  
   – Q1 FY 2025: \$359 M  
   – Dollar increase = \$515 M − \$359 M = **\$156 million**

"After deploying Palantir Eval-Driven Automation in AIP as showcased in the DevCon 2 overview, by how much did Wendy's QSCC shorten its supply chain problem resolution cycle and how much did Heineken accelerate its solution build time?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving QSCC, After, AIP.

After rolling out Eval-Driven Automation in AIP (as demoed at DevCon 2), our two anchor customers reported the following dramatic compressions in cycle times:

1. Wendy’s QSCC – Supply-chain problem resolution  
   - Before AIP: issues “would go on for weeks and days.”  
     • For illustration, if we assume **2 weeks** (14 days) to resolution:  
       – 14 days × 24 hr/day × 60 min/hr = 20 160 minutes  
   - After AIP: same issue fixed in **5 minutes**  
   - Reduction:  
     • Absolute drop = 20 160 min − 5 min = 20 155 minutes  
     • Percentage reduction ≈ (20 155 ÷ 20 160)×100 ≈ 99.98 %  
   - In plain terms: cycle time collapsed from **weeks** to **minutes**.

2. Heineken – Solution-build time  
   - Before AIP: builds took **3 years** (36 months)  
   - After AIP: comparable builds delivered in **3 months**  
   - Reduction:  
     • Absolute drop = 36 months − 3 months = 33 months  
     • Speed-up factor = 36 ÷ 3 = 12 × faster  
     • Percentage reduction = (33 ÷ 36)×100 ≈ 91.7 %

Below is a step‐by‐step reconciliation of how Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs changed between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, expressed as a percentage of the total scheduled long-term debt principal.  

**1. Extract the face (scheduled) principal amounts**  
From Note 10 (Long-Term Debt) on pages 16 and 29 of the 10-Q:  

• 3.20% Notes due 2026: \$1,000 million  
• 1.55% Notes due 2028: \$1,250 million  
• 2.85% Notes due 2030: \$1,500 million

• As of January 26, 2025: \$(37) million  
• As of April 27, 2025: \$(36) million  

(The amounts appear as a contra‐liability, hence the parentheses.)  

**3. Compute each period’s discount & costs as a percentage of \$8,500 million**  

  • January 26, 2025 ratio  
    = ( 37 / 8,500 ) × 100%  
    = 0.435294…% ≈ **0.4353%**  

  • April 27, 2025 ratio  
    = ( 36 / 8,500 ) × 100%  
    = 0.423529…% ≈ **0.4235%**  

**4. Calculate the change between the two dates**  

  Change in rate = April 27 ratio – January 26 ratio  
                = 0.423529% – 0.435294%  
                = –0.011765%  

Rounding to appropriate precision gives a decrease of **0.0118 percentage points**, or about **1.18 basis points**.  

**Summary**  
Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025:  
– Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs fell from 0.4353% of scheduled debt principal to 0.4235%,  
– A net decrease of 0.0118 percentage points (≈ 1.18 bps) of the \$8.5 billion face amount.

"Which four factors did NVIDIA cite in Note 4 of its Q1 FY2026 financial statements for its effective tax rate being lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, what was that effective tax rate, and what estimated long-term annual effective tax rate did Palantir apply to its income tax effect for market-vesting SARs?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving Which, Note, rate.

1. NVIDIA’s Q1 FY 2026 effective tax rate (Note 4)  
   – Income before tax (1Q 2026): \$21,910 million  
   – Income tax expense (1Q 2026): \$3,135 million  
   – Effective tax rate = \$3,135 / \$21,910 ≈ 14.3%  

   NVIDIA explains that its ~14.3% rate was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to four items:  
   1. Tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction  
   2. Tax benefits on stock-based compensation  
   3. Income earned in jurisdictions subject to tax at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate  
   4. The U.S. federal research tax credit  

   (Source: Note 4, “Our effective tax rates … were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to …”)  

2. Palantir’s estimate of the long-term annual effective tax rate for market-vesting SARs  
   In the reconciliation of GAAP net income to net income excluding one-time, market-vesting SAR expenses, Palantir applies an estimated long-term annual effective tax rate of **23.0%** to the combined stock-based compensation and related payroll-tax expense.  

   – Example calculation (Q4 2024 basis):  
     • Accelerated SBC expense: \$115,776 thousand  
     • Employer payroll taxes on SBC: \$15,528 thousand  
     • Total SAR-related compensation expense: \$131,304 thousand  
     • Tax effect at 23%: 0.23 × \$131,304 = \$30,200 thousand

   In other words, for the quarter ended April 27, 2025, NVIDIA met the definition of a Large accelerated filer.  

3. Gross profit margin for the quarter ended April 27, 2025  
   From the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the three months ended April 27, 2025:  
   – Revenue: $44,062 million  
   – Cost of revenue: $17,394 million  
   – Gross profit: $26,668 million  

   Gross profit margin = Gross profit ÷ Revenue  
     = $26,668 ÷ $44,062  
     ≃ 0.605 = 60.5%

"In the three months ended April 27, 2025, what percentage of Nvidia’s consolidated Operating income was absorbed by the All Other category’s Stock-based compensation expense and what percentage of the Compute & Networking segment’s Revenue was consumed by its Other segment items?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving Compute, Stock, percentage.

Below is a step-by-step calculation for the two ratios in the quarter ended April 27, 2025.  

**1. Stock-based compensation in “All Other” as a percentage of consolidated operating income**  
Sources (three months ended Apr 27, 2025):  
• Consolidated Operating Income (Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income)     $ 21,638 M  
• Stock-based comp in “All Other” (Note 13 reconciling items)                  $ 1,474 M  

Calculation:  
1. Take the absolute stock-based compensation charge:  
   1,474 ÷ 21,638 = 0.06812  
2. Convert to percentage:  
   0.06812 × 100 = 6.81 %  

**Answer:** In Q1 2026, the “All Other” stock-based compensation charge of $ 1,474 million absorbed approximately **6.81 %** of Nvidia’s consolidated operating income.  

---  

**2. “Other segment items” in Compute & Networking as a percentage of that segment’s revenue**  
Sources (three months ended Apr 27, 2025, from Note 13 “Segment Information”):  
• Compute & Networking Revenue                                    $ 39,589 M  
• Compute & Networking Other segment items (primarily product costs, inventory provisions, comp. & benefits excl. SBC, etc.)

Calculation:  
1. Divide the Other segment items by the segment’s top-line:  
   17,535 ÷ 39,589 = 0.44326  
2. Convert to percentage:  
   0.44326 × 100 = 44.33 %  

**Answer:** In the same quarter, the Compute & Networking segment’s “Other segment items” consumed **44.33 %** of that segment’s revenue.

"In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, what was NVIDIA's interest coverage ratio (interest income divided by interest expense) and what percentage of its net interest spread did net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities—driven by fair value volatility in investments including CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.—consume?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving ratio, percentage, In.

Below is the step-by-step calculation for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 (three months ended April 27, 2025):  

**1. Interest Coverage Ratio**  
Interest coverage ratio is defined here as:
  
      Interest Coverage Ratio = Interest Income / Interest Expense  

From the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income:  
  • Interest income (Q1 FY26) = \$515 million  
  • Interest expense (Q1 FY26) = \$63 million  

Step 1.1 – Divide interest income by interest expense:  
      \$515 M ÷ \$63 M = 8.1746  

Step 1.2 – Express as a percentage (× 100):  
      8.1746 × 100 = 817.5 %  

**Answer, Part 1:**  
   Interest coverage ratio = 515 / 63 ≈ 8.17 times (or 817.5 %)  

> Source: “Interest income \$515; Interest expense \$63” (Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income)  

---

**2. Net Interest Spread and Impact of Net Unrealized Losses**  
Net interest spread (net interest income) is:  
  
      Net Interest Spread = Interest Income − Interest Expense  

From above:  
  • Interest Income = \$515 M  
  • Interest Expense = \$63 M  

Step 2.1 – Compute net interest spread:  
      \$515 M − \$63 M = \$452 million  

Step 2.2 – Identify net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities:  
      Net unrealized losses (Q1 FY26) = \$222 million  

  (Note 5 disclosure: “Net unrealized losses on investments in publicly-held equity securities held at period end were \$222 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.”)  

Step 2.3 – Compute % of spread consumed:  
      \$222 M ÷ \$452 M = 0.4912 → 49.12 %  

**Answer, Part 2:**  
   Net unrealized losses of \$222 M consumed \$222/452 ≈ 49.1 % of the net interest spread.

"In NVIDIA's first quarter of fiscal 2026, by how many percentage points did interest income as a share of gross profit increase year-over-year, and how did that compare to the year-over-year percentage increase in research and development expenses?","💡 Summary: This answer addresses financial_calculation involving percentage, profit, fiscal.

Below is the detailed calculation for Q1 FY 2026 (three months ended April 27, 2025) compared with Q1 FY 2025 (ended April 28, 2024):

1. Interest income as a percentage of gross profit  
   • Q1 FY 2026  
     – Gross profit: \$26,668 million  
     – Interest income: \$515 million  
     – Interest income ÷ Gross profit = 515 / 26,668 = 0.01932 = **1.93%**  
   • Q1 FY 2025  
     – Gross profit: \$20,406 million  
     – Interest income: \$359 million  
     – Interest income ÷ Gross profit = 359 / 20,406 = 0.01758 = **1.76%**  
   • Year-over-year change  
     = 1.93% − 1.76% = **0.17 percentage points**  

2. Year-over-year increase in research and development expenses  
   From the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Operating Expenses table):  
   • Q1 FY 2026 R&D expense: \$3,989 million  
   • Q1 FY 2025 R&D expense: \$2,720 million  
   • Increase: \$3,989 − \$2,720 = \$1,269 million  
   • Percentage increase = 1,269 / 2,720 = 0.4665 = **46.7%** (rounded to **47%** as reported)  

Comparison  
– Interest income as a share of gross profit rose by **0.17 percentage points** year-over-year.  
– R&D spend jumped **47%** year-over-year.

"What manufacturing lead times has NVIDIA previously experienced, which fiscal quarter saw gross margins negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material, and in which quarter are sample shipments of Blackwell Ultra expected to commence?","1. In its “Risk Factors” (Item 1A), NVIDIA notes that “we have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months.”  
2. NVIDIA’s gross margins were “negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material” in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.  
3. Under “Recent Developments” in the MD&A, NVIDIA states it expects to begin sample (and production) shipments of its Blackwell Ultra platforms in the second quarter of fiscal 2026."
"What percentage of historical infrastructure total returns is driven by income, what tax rates were assumed for long-term and short-term capital gains in J.P. Morgan’s after-tax hedge fund performance analysis, and by what factor has client utilization of equity-linked structured notes increased this year compared to 2024?","1. Infrastructure income-share  
   Over 40 percent of historical infrastructure total returns have been driven by income.¹

2. Hedge-fund after-tax assumptions  
   J.P. Morgan assumed a 23.8 percent tax rate for long-term capital gains and 43.4 percent for short-term capital gains in its after-tax hedge-fund performance analysis.²

"In Q1 2025, by how many percentage points does the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue, and by how many percentage points lower is that excess than the spread between US commercial and US government revenue growth rates?","Here’s the math step by step:

1.  Q1 2025 YoY growth rates  
    - Total revenue: +39%  
    - Total revenue excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts: +44%  
    ⇒ Exclusion “excess” = 44% − 39% = **5 pp**

2.  Q1 2025 US segment YoY growth  
    - US commercial: +71%  
    - US government: +45%  
    ⇒ Commercial vs. government “spread” = 71% − 45% = **26 pp**

3.  Compare the two  
    - The 5 pp exclusion-vs-total excess is 26 pp − 5 pp = **21 pp lower** than the US commercial vs. government spread.

**Answer**  
• The excl-SCC growth rate exceeds total revenue growth by 5 percentage points.  
• That 5 pp excess is 21 percentage points smaller than the 26 pp gap between US commercial and US government growth."
"What is the ratio of the U.S. dollar's share of global central bank foreign exchange reserves in 2024 to the euro's share of SWIFT settlements, and by how many percentage points does the dollar's share of SWIFT trade finance settlements exceed its share of international debt?","The key figures are laid out in the section “Is this the downfall of the U.S. dollar?” (2025 Mid-Year Outlook, p. 21):

- U.S. dollar’s share of global central-bank FX reserves in 2024: 60%  
- Euro’s share of SWIFT settlements: 6%  
- U.S. dollar’s share of SWIFT trade-finance settlements: 85%  
- U.S. dollar’s share of international debt: 65%

1. Ratio of dollar FX-reserve share to euro SWIFT share  
   = 60% / 6% = 10  

2. By how many percentage points does the dollar’s SWIFT trade-finance share exceed its international-debt share?  
   = 85% − 65% = 20 percentage points  

— Source: “But we believe those risks will manifest… Today, the dollar makes up 60% of foreign exchange reserves, 65% of international debt and nearly 85% of SWIFT trade finance settlements.… The second most used currency, the euro, accounts for just 6% of SWIFT settlements.” (pp. 20–21)"

"On a quarter-over-quarter basis, by how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s net working capital change, by how many millions of dollars did its retained earnings increase, and what percentage of that retained earnings increase was consumed by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets?","Here are the three metrics, all on a quarter-over-quarter basis from January 26, 2025 to April 27, 2025:

1. Net working capital change  
   - Current assets rose from \$80,126 M to \$89,935 M (∆ +\$9,809 M)  
   - Current liabilities rose from \$18,047 M to \$26,542 M (∆ +\$8,495 M)  
   - ⇒ Net working capital increased by \$9,809 M – \$8,495 M = **\$1,314 million**  
     (See Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets)

2. Retained-earnings increase  
   - Retained earnings at January 26, 2025: \$68,038 M  
   - Retained earnings at April 27, 2025:   \$72,158 M  
   - ⇒ Increase = \$72,158 M – \$68,038 M = **\$4,120 million**  
     (See Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets)

3. Percentage of that increase consumed by purchases of property & equipment and intangibles  
   - “Purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets” for the quarter: \$1,227 M (cash outflow)  
   - % consumed = (1,227 / 4,120) × 100 ≃ **29.8 %** (≈ 30 %)

"In Q1 FY26, following the USG’s April 9, 2025 export licensing requirements that diminished demand for H20 products, what percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales did NVIDIA’s related excess inventory charge represent, and by how many percentage points did that percentage exceed Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin?","**Answer:**

- NVIDIA’s excess‐inventory charge of \$4.5 billion represented \$4.5 billion / \$4.6 billion ≈ **97.8 %** of its H20 sales in Q1 FY 2026 before the new export‐license rules.  
- Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin (per their “Cash from Operations and Adjusted Free Cash Flow” slide) was **42 %**.  
- Thus, NVIDIA’s charge‐to‐sales ratio (≈97.8 %) exceeded Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted margin (42 %) by roughly **56 percentage points** (97.8 % – 42 % ≈ 55.8 ppt).

"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","The two key numbers are:  

1. Investor‐sentiment versus market‐stress ratio  
   - Net share of investors expecting further USD depreciation (“net 61%”)  
   - Three‐year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous U.S. stock, bond and USD declines (“≈ 7.5%”)  
   → 61% / 7.5% ≈ 8.1   (i.e. investors are ~8× more bearish than real‐world stress days)  

2. Unhedged ex-U.S. bonds vs. USD-domestic bonds volatility  
   - Over the past 20 years, an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio has seen almost 2× the volatility of a USD-domestic bond portfolio.  

Putting it together:  

- Sentiment-to-stress ratio ≈ 8 to 1  
- Volatility multiple ≈ 2 to 1  

In other words, the “fear” gauge (≈ 8×) is roughly four times as large as the actual volatility penalty for unhedged foreign bonds (≈ 2×).
