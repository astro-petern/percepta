"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Year-over-year growth rates (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)  
   • Total revenue: +39 % Y/Y  
     – “Revenue grew +39 % Y/Y … to $884 million” (Q1 ’25 Highlights)  
   • Revenue ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts: +44 % Y/Y  
     – “…+44 % Y/Y … excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” (Q1 ’25 Highlights)  
   • U.S. revenue: +55 % Y/Y  
     – “US revenue grew +55 % Y/Y … to $628 million” (Q1 ’25 Highlights)

2. Standard deviation of those three Y/Y rates  
   – Data set: [39 %, 44 %, 55 %]  
   – Mean = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46 %  
   – Population σ = √[((39–46)²+(44–46)²+(55–46)²)/3]  
               ≈ √[(49+4+81)/3] ≈ √(44.67) ≈ 6.7 pp  
   *(If you use the sample formula (n–1) in the denominator, σ≈8.2 pp.)*

3. QoQ changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 ’23 → Q1 ’25)  
   Rule of 40 by quarter (from Appendix):  
     Q2 ’23 → 38 %  
     Q3 ’23 → 46 %  
     Q4 ’23 → 54 %  
     Q1 ’24 → 57 %  
     Q2 ’24 → 64 %  
     Q3 ’24 → 68 %  
     Q4 ’24 → 81 %  
     Q1 ’25 → 83 %  

   Quarter-over-quarter deltas:  
     [46–38, 54–46, 57–54, 64–57, 68–64, 81–68, 83–81]  
     = [8, 8, 3, 7, 4, 13, 2] pp  

   – Mean Δ ≈45/7 ≈ 6.43 pp  
   – Population σ = √[Σ(Δ–6.43)²/7] ≈ 3.5 pp  
     *(Sample σ ≈ 3.8 pp.)*

4. Relation to Q1 ’25 Rule of 40 = 83 %  
   – Despite comparatively wide dispersion in the three Y/Y growth rates (σ≈6.7 pp), the quarter-to-quarter swings in Rule of 40 have been much tighter (σ≈3.5 pp).  
   – By Q1 2025 the Company’s Rule of 40 has climbed to 83 %, more than double the 40 % “hurdle,” and it has done so with steadily improving (and relatively low-volatility) quarterly gains."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","First, let’s pull the key numbers:

  • Q1 2024  
    – Revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts: \$610 M  
    – Adjusted Operating Income: \$226 M  
    – TTM US Commercial Customers (3/31/24): 262  

  • Q1 2025  
    – Revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts: \$879 M  
    – Adjusted Operating Income: \$391 M  
    – TTM US Commercial Customers (3/31/25): 432  

1. Compute Operating Expense = (Revenue excl.) − (Adjusted Op Income)  
  • Q1 2024: 610 − 226 = \$384 M  
  • Q1 2025: 879 − 391 = \$488 M  

2. Divide by # of US Commercial Customers to get expense per customer  
  • Q1 2024: 384 / 262 ≈ \$1.466 M/customer  
  • Q1 2025: 488 / 432 ≈ \$1.130 M/customer  

3. Calculate the year-over-year change  
  %Δ = (1.130 − 1.466) / 1.466 ≈ −0.229 ⇒ −22.9%  

Answer: Operating expense per US commercial customer fell by roughly 23% year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in total other assets  
   – As of January 26, 2025: $ 6,425 million  
   – As of April 27, 2025:    $ 6,788 million  
   – Increase: $ 6,788 – $ 6,425 = **$ 363 million**  
   (Note – “Total other assets,” Apr 27, 2025 vs. Jan 26, 2025)¹  

2. Change in assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment & intangible assets  
   – Q1 FY2026: $ 408 million  
   – Q1 FY2025: $ 147 million  
   – Increase: $ 408 – $ 147 = **$ 261 million**  
   (Note – “Property, equipment and intangible assets acquired by assuming related liabilities” for Q1 FY2026 vs. Q1 FY2025)²  

3. Intangible-asset amortization as a percentage of Q1 FY2026 assumed-liability acquisitions  
   – Amortization expense, Q1 FY2026: $ 159 million  
   – Assumed-liability acquisitions, Q1 FY2026: $ 408 million  
   – Percentage: $159 / 408 × 100 ≈ **39 %**

"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","The fair value of the CoreWeave investment as of April 27, 2025 was $1,000 million (i.e. $1 billion) (Note 5).  In Q1 FY 26, the carrying-value “Reclassification” recorded against non-marketable equity securities was $843 million (Note 6).  

$1,000 million – $843 million = $157 million.  

So, the fair value exceeded the reclassification adjustment by $157 million."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Here are the figures referenced (noting that, in reality, Palantir’s 83% Rule-of-40 score is ​not​ computed this way):  

1. Adjusted free cash flow margin (Q1 2025): 42%  
   (Source: “Adjusted free cash flow of $370 million; 42% margin”)

2. US Government revenue Q/Q growth (Q1 2025 vs. Q4 2024): +9%  
   (Source: “US government revenue grew +45% Y/Y and +9% Q/Q to $373 million”)

3. Cash, cash equivalents and US Treasury securities (quarter-end Q1 2025): $5.4 billion

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","After pulling the numbers out of the two schedules, we get:

1)  Cash‐flow items (stock‐based comp. + D&A)  
   – 2025 Q1:  \$1,474 M + \$611 M = \$2,085 M  
   – 2024 Q1:  \$1,011 M + \$410 M = \$1,421 M  
   – YoY growth: (2,085 – 1,421)/1,421 ≈ 46.7%

2)  Income‐statement items (net change in unrealized AFS gains/(losses) + total other income (expense), net)  
   – 2025 Q1:  \$139 M + \$272 M = \$411 M  
   – 2024 Q1: (–\$128 M) + \$370 M = \$242 M  
   – YoY growth: (411 – 242)/242 ≈ 69.8%

Result: The combined unrealized-gains plus other-income line grew faster (≈69.8%) than the stock-based-compensation + D&A line (≈46.7%), and it exceeded it by about 23.1 percentage points.

"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","The Form 10-Q shows that, rather than falling, NVIDIA’s net cash provided by operating activities actually rose from $15.345 billion in Q1 FY 2025 to $27.414 billion in Q1 FY 2026—a year-over-year increase of $12.069 billion.  Management attributes the swing principally to:  
  - Higher revenue in the quarter, and  
  - The timing of cash collections.

"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","The Y/Y growth ex-strategic-commercial contracts was 44%, versus 39% overall – a 5 pp outperformance. 

- Total revenue (Q1 ’24 → Q1 ’25) grew +39% Y/Y  
- Revenue ex. Strategic Commercial Contracts (Q1 ’24 → Q1 ’25) grew +44% Y/Y  
→ 44% − 39% = 5 percentage points."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Below is a summary of the three items you asked for, together with the workings and the relevant citations.

1) Quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value by contractual maturity  
   From the “Amortized Cost and Estimated Fair Value by Contractual Maturity” table (Note 5):  

   Apr 27, 2025 vs Jan 26, 2025  
   • Less than one year: 25,781 – 18,450 = + 7,331 million  
   • Due in 1-5 years:      26,355 – 23,656 = + 2,699 million  
   • Total:                52,136 – 42,106 = + 10,030 million  

   Mean change = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030)/3 = 6,686.7  
   Variance = [(7,331–6,686.7)² + (2,699–6,686.7)² + (10,030–6,686.7)²] / 3  
            ≈ 9,166,535  
   Standard deviation ≈ √9,166,535 ≈ **3,028 million**  

   (If one were to use the sample formula (n–1 in the denominator), σ ≈ 3,709 million.)  

2) Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities at Jan 26, 2025  
   From the “Corporate debt securities” line in the cash-equivalents/marketable-securities roll-forward:  
   • Unrealized gain = **$ 51 million** (Unrealized loss was $ 29 million)  
   (See Note 5, Jan 26, 2025 column.)  

3) % increase in Level 1 money market funds (Apr 27 vs Jan 26)  
   From the Level 1 fair-value roll-forward (Note 6 – Cash equivalents & marketable securities):  
   • Jan 26, 2025 Level 1 money market funds = $ 3,760 million  
   • Apr 27, 2025 Level 1 money market funds = $ 6,522 million  
   Increase = 6,522 – 3,760 = 2,762  
   % increase = 2,762/3,760 × 100 ≈ **73.4 %**  

   (The Company notes that “gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates.”)

"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","**Answer:** The “acceleration” in GAAP operating income from Q4 2024→Q1 2025 versus Q3 2024→Q4 2024 was:

- ΔQ3→Q4 2024: 11.0 – 113.1 = –102.1 M  
- ΔQ4 2024→Q1 2025: 176.0 – 11.0 = +165.0 M  
- Acceleration₍OpInc₎ = 165.0 – (–102.1) = 267.1 M  

For GAAP net income:

- ΔQ3→Q4 2024: 79.0 – 143.5 = –64.5 M  
- ΔQ4 2024→Q1 2025: 214.0 – 79.0 = +135.0 M  
- Acceleration₍NetInc₎ = 135.0 – (–64.5) = 199.5 M  

The operating-income acceleration thus exceeded the net-income acceleration by  
267.1 M – 199.5 M ≈ **$67.6 million**.

Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a % of accrued and other current liabilities  
   From January 26, 2025 to April 27, 2025:  
   • Jan 26, 2025 – Excess inventory purchase obligations $2,095 / total accrued and other current liabilities $11,737 = 17.9%

   • Change = 22.4% – 17.9% = +4.5 percentage points  

2. Outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply & capacity obligations as a % of net long-term debt (Apr 27, 2025)  
   • Commitments (inventory purchase + long-term supply & capacity) = $29.8 billion

- Total global commercial customers rose from 427→622, a net gain of 195.  
- US commercial customers rose from 262→432, a net gain of 170.  
→ Non-US commercial customer adds = 195 − 170 = 25.

"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","For the four consecutive quarters ending Mar 31, 2025, US Commercial customer-count Q/Q growth rates are  
  • +13%, +9%, +19%, +13%  
and Total customer-count Q/Q growth rates are  
  • +7%, +6%, +13%, +8%  

If you compute the standard deviation of each series (treating them as a population):  
  σ(commercial) ≃ 3.57%  
  σ(total)      ≃ 2.69%  

Their ratio is therefore:  
  3.57 ÷ 2.69 ≃ 1.33  

→ The US commercial segment’s quarterly growth is about 1.3× more volatile than overall customer growth.  In other words, even though management is reporting a smooth +65% Y/Y increase in US commercial customers, the underlying quarter-to-quarter gains swing about 30% more than the total-company customer base does."
