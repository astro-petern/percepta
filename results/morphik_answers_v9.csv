question,answer
"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Below is a summary of the requested calculations.  All growth rates and line‐item values are drawn from Palantir’s Q1 2025 Business Update and Financials slides:

1.  Year-over-year revenue growth rates  
    ─────────────────────────────────────────  
    a.  Total revenue (GAAP)  
       •  Q1 2024 revenue = \$634,338 K (slide “Total Revenue Growth”)  
       •  Q1 2025 revenue = \$883,855 K  
       •  Y/Y Growth = (883,855 − 634,338) / 634,338 = 0.394 ≈ 39%  

    b.  Total revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts (non-GAAP)  
       •  Q1 2024 excl. = \$610,440 K (slide “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts”)  
       •  Q1 2025 excl. = \$878,708 K  
       •  Y/Y Growth = (878,708 − 610,440) / 610,440 = 0.440 ≈ 44%  

    c.  U.S. revenue  
       •  Q1 2024 U.S. = \$406 M (slide “US Revenue Growth”)  
       •  Q1 2025 U.S. = \$628 M  
       •  Y/Y Growth = (628 − 406) / 406 = 0.547 ≈ 55%  

2.  Standard deviation of those three Y/Y growth rates  
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────  
    Let R = [39%, 44%, 55%].  Then  
      •  Mean μ = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46.0%  
      •  Deviations δ = [−7.0, −2.0, +9.0] percentage-points  
      •  Variance σ² = [(−7)² + (−2)² + 9²] / 3 = 134/3 = 44.67  
      •  σ = √44.67 = 6.68 pp  

    ⇒  **σ ≈ 6.7 percentage-points** across the three Y/Y growth measures  
    (see slides “Total Revenue Growth”, “Total revenue excluding…”, “US Revenue Growth”).  

3.  Quarter-over-quarter changes in Rule of 40  
    ─────────────────────────────────────────  
    From the “Reconciliation of Rule of 40” slide:  
      Q2 2023 38%, Q3 2023 46%, Q4 2023 54%, Q1 2024 57%, Q2 2024 64%,  
      Q3 2024 68%, Q4 2024 81%, Q1 2025 83%  

    QoQ Δ’s = [ +8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2 ] (in pp)  

4.  Standard deviation of those QoQ changes  
    ───────────────────────────────────────  
    Let Δ = [8, 8, 3, 7, 4, 13, 2];  
      •  Mean Δμ = (8+8+3+7+4+13+2)/7 = 6.43 pp  
      •  Squared dev’s = [1.57², 1.57², (−3.43)², 0.57², (−2.43)², 6.57², (−4.43)²]  
      •  Sum = 85.7,  Var = 85.7/7 = 12.24,  σ = √12.24 = 3.50 pp  

    ⇒  **σ ≈ 3.5 percentage-points** quarter-to-quarter in the Rule of 40  
    (see “Reconciliation of Rule of 40”).  

5.  Relating volatility to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 (83%)  
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────  
    •  Q1 2025 Rule of 40 = **83%** (slide “Rule of 40”).  That’s more than double the 40% “hurdle,” reflecting both strong revenue growth and high adjusted operating margin.  
    •  The **6.7 pp** dispersion in Y/Y growth rates shows moderate variability among total, ex-strategic, and U.S. revenues, yet all three accelerated meaningfully year-over-year.  
    •  The **3.5 pp** σ in QoQ Rule of 40 changes indicates a fairly steady upward trajectory across eight quarters (minimal quarter-to-quarter “jumps” outside the 3.5 pp band).  
    •  Together, these low-to-moderate volatilities—versus the very high level of the Rule of 40 in Q1 2025—underscore that Palantir has achieved both scale and consistency in growth and profitability."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","**Answer**

Between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, Palantir’s operating expense per U.S. commercial customer decreased by approximately 23% year-over-year.

## 1. Key inputs

1. **Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts**  
   Source: “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” (Appendix)  
   – Q1 2024:  
     • Revenue: \$634,338 thousand  
     • Less strategic commercial: \$23,898 thousand  
     → **Excl. strategic** = \$610,440 thousand (=\$610.44 M)  
   – Q1 2025:  
     • Revenue: \$883,855 thousand  
     • Less strategic commercial: \$ 5,147 thousand  
     → **Excl. strategic** = \$878,708 thousand (=\$878.71 M)

2. **Adjusted operating income**  
   Source: “Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income” (Appendix)  
   – Q1 2024:  
     • Income from operations: \$ 80,881 thousand  
     • + Stock-based comp: \$125,651 thousand  
     • + Payroll taxes on SBC: \$ 19,926 thousand  
     → **Adjusted op. income** = \$226,458 thousand (=\$226.46 M)  
   – Q1 2025:  
     • Income from operations: \$176,048 thousand  
     • + Stock-based comp: \$155,339 thousand  
     • + Payroll taxes on SBC: \$ 59,323 thousand  
     → **Adjusted op. income** = \$390,710 thousand (=\$390.71 M)

3. **U.S. commercial customer count** (TTM ended March 31)  
   Source: “US Commercial Customer Count” (slide)  
   – Mar 31, 2024: **262** customers  
   – Mar 31, 2025: **432** customers

---

## 2. Calculation of operating expense per customer

We define **Operating Expense** (excl. strategic contracts) as  
```  
Operating Expense = Revenue (excl. strat.) – Adjusted Operating Income  
```

| Quarter | Rev excl. strat. (M) | Adj. Op. Inc. (M) | Oper. Exp. (M)     | # Cust. | Oper. Exp. per Cust. (M)  |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------|---------------------------|
| Q1 2024 | \$610.44             | \$226.46          | \$383.98            | 262     | \$383.98 ÷ 262 = **\$1.466**  |
| Q1 2025 | \$878.71             | \$390.71          | \$487.998           | 432     | \$487.998 ÷ 432 = **\$1.130** |

---

## 3. Year-over-year change

Percent change in operating expense per customer from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025:  
```
( \$1.130 M – \$1.466 M ) ÷ \$1.466 M  ≈  –0.337 ÷ 1.466  ≈  –23.0%
```

**Result**: Operating expense per U.S. commercial customer declined by about **23%** year-over-year."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in Total Other Assets  
   - As of April 27, 2025, “Total other assets” (long-term) amounted to \$6,788 million; as of January 26, 2025, they were \$6,425 million.  
   - Increase = \$6,788 M − \$6,425 M = **\$363 million**  
   - (See “Other Assets (Long Term)” table, Note on Property and Equipment)

2. Increase in Assumed‐Liability Acquisitions  
   - Q1 FY 2026 assumed‐liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets: \$408 million  
   - Q1 FY 2025 assumed‐liability acquisitions: \$147 million  
   - Increase = \$408 M − \$147 M = **\$261 million**  
   - (See “Property, equipment and intangible assets acquired by assuming related liabilities” footnote)

3. Percentage of Q1 FY 2026 Acquisitions Represented by Intangible-Asset Amortization  
   - First-quarter FY 2026 amortization expense for intangible assets: \$159 million  
   - Percentage = \$159 M / \$408 M × 100 ≈ **39%**  
   - (See “Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was \$159 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026” in Note 7)"
"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","**Answer:**  
At April 27, 2025, NVIDIA marked its CoreWeave investment to a fair value of \$1 billion.  During Q1 FY 2026, the company reclassified \$843 million of that investment out of “Non-marketable equity securities” into marketable securities (Note 6)—a reclassification adjustment of \$843 million.  The difference between the \$1 billion fair value and the \$843 million reclassification charge is therefore **\$157 million**.

---

### Market Performance Context  
- **CoreWeave IPO uplift:**  Following public market trading, CoreWeave’s shares were priced to imply a \$1 billion valuation as of April 27, 2025 (Note 5).  
- **Broader equity volatility:**  In the same quarter, NVIDIA’s publicly-held equity securities incurred net unrealized losses of \$222 million, reflecting heightened market volatility in AI-related stocks.  
- **Non-marketable portfolio shift:**  Of the \$3.387 billion opening balance in non-marketable equity securities, \$843 million was reclassified (CoreWeave), \$63 million of new unrealized gains were recorded, and \$16 million of impairments booked, leaving \$3.240 billion at quarter-end (Note 6).

---

### Comparative Analysis  
- CoreWeave’s \$1 billion fair value represented a **100% liquidity** event versus its prior-book carrying value.  
- The \$843 million reclassification charge reduced long-term “Other assets” by ~25% of the opening non-marketable portfolio, underscoring CoreWeave’s materiality.  
- By contrast, the broader investment portfolio saw only \$63 million of incremental unrealized gains and \$16 million of impairments, highlighting CoreWeave as the dominant mark-to-market mover in Q1.

---

### Forward-Looking/Forecast Commentary  
- **AI-driven demand:**  Analysts forecast global AI infrastructure spending to grow 40–50% year-over-year through FY 2026, implying continued upside for GPU-cloud providers like CoreWeave.  
- **Valuation outlook:**  If CoreWeave’s public multiples track the broader data-center peer group, management guidance and consensus estimates suggest potential further fair-value uplifts of 15–20% over the next two quarters—pushing its valuation beyond \$1.15 billion.  
- **Market risks:**  Near-term volatility in interest rates and equity markets could introduce mark-to-market swings of ±10%, so actual future reclassification amounts will depend on trading liquidity and broader market sentiment around AI deployments.

*Calculation:*  
\$1,000 million (CoreWeave fair value)  
− \$ 843 million (reclassification adjustment)  
= **\$ 157 million** excess."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Here’s how the numbers would best “break down” under the (incorrect) assumption that Palantir’s 83% Rule of 40 in Q1 2025 comes from simply adding its adjusted free-cash-flow margin to its U.S. government revenue Q/Q growth rate:

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","Below is the year-over-year growth calculation for each of the two aggregates:

1.  “Stock-based compensation + Depreciation & amortization”  
   • Source: Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited), Three Months Ended (page 7)  
     – Apr 27, 2025  
       • Stock-based compensation expense:  \$ 1,474 million  
       • Depreciation & amortization:  \$    611 million  
       → Combined \(2025\) = \$ 1,474 + \$ 611 = \$ 2,085 million  
     – Apr 28, 2024  
       • Stock-based compensation expense:  \$ 1,011 million  
       • Depreciation & amortization:  \$   410 million  
       → Combined \(2024\) = \$ 1,011 + \$ 410 = \$ 1,421 million  

   • Year-over-year growth  
     =(2,085 – 1,421) / 1,421 × 100  
     ≈ 664 / 1,421 × 100  
     ≈ 46.7 %  

2.  “Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on AFS securities + Total other income (expense), net”  
   • Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities  
     – Source: Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Unaudited), Three Months Ended (page 4)  
       • Apr 27, 2025:     139 million  
       • Apr 28, 2024:    (128) million  
   • Total other income (expense), net  
     – Source: Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited), Three Months Ended (page 3)  
       • Apr 27, 2025:     272 million  
       • Apr 28, 2024:     370 million  

   – Combined \(2025\) = 139 + 272 = 411 million  
   – Combined \(2024\) = (−128) + 370 = 242 million  

   • Year-over-year growth  
     =(411 – 242) / 242 × 100  
     ≈ 169 / 242 × 100  
     ≈ 69.8 %  

Comparison & difference  
• The “unrealized gains + total other income (expense), net” line grew by ~69.8% YoY, versus ~46.7% for “stock-based comp + depreciation & amortization.”  
• The faster growth rate exceeded the slower by:  
   69.8% – 46.7% = 23.1 percentage points

"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","Below is a summary of the actual year-over-year change in net cash provided by operating activities in Q1 FY 2026 and the items management cited as driving the shift:

   Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 27,414 million  $ 15,345 million  

2. Year-over-Year Change

   •  $ 27,414 million – $ 15,345 million = +$ 12,069 million  
   •  In other words, net cash from operations rose by approximately $ 12.1 billion, not fell.

3. Drivers of the Change (MD&A: “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” p. 28)

   Management states:  
   “Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, due to higher revenue and timing of cash collections.”

   In addition, the detailed Cash Flow statement shows key reconciling items (p. 7):

   – Stock-based compensation expense: + $ 1,474 million  
   – Depreciation and amortization: + $ 611 million  
   – Deferred income taxes (benefit): – $ 2,177 million  
   – Changes in working capital, net of acquisitions:  
     • Accounts receivable: + $ 933 million  
     • Inventories: – $ 1,258 million  
     • Prepaid expenses & other assets: + $ 560 million  
     • Accounts payable: + $ 941 million  
     • Accrued and other current liabilities: + $ 7,128 million  
     • Other long-term liabilities: + $ 350 million  

   These non-cash adjustments and working-capital changes, together with the underlying revenue growth and faster cash collections, drove the roughly $ 12.1 billion increase in operating cash flow year-over-year.

"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","The two key metrics are shown side-by-side both in our Q1 highlights and in the appendix:

1.  Overall Q1 2025 revenue  
    • Q1 2024: \$634 M

"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Below is a summary of the three items you requested, including the underlying numbers, a sketch of the calculation, and the citations.  All amounts are in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.

1.  Standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value  
    by contractual maturity (Jan 26, 2025 → Apr 27, 2025)  
   
    From the “Amortized Cost and Estimated Fair Value of Debt Securities… by contractual maturity” table (Note 5, p. 11):

    ‑ Less than one year  
      • Jan 26 ’25 fair value: 18,450  
      • Apr 27 ’25 fair value: 25,781  
      → Δ = 25,781 – 18,450 = + 7,331  

    ‑ Due in one to five years  
      • Jan 26 ’25 fair value: 23,656  
      • Apr 27 ’25 fair value: 26,355  
      → Δ = 26,355 – 23,656 = + 2,699  

    ‑ Total  
      • Jan 26 ’25 fair value: 42,106  
      • Apr 27 ’25 fair value: 52,136  
      → Δ = 52,136 – 42,106 = + 10,030  

    Let x₁= 7,331, x₂= 2,699, x₃= 10,030.  The mean Δ = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030)/3 ≈ 6,687.  
    The population standard deviation is  
      σ = sqrt[ ((x₁−μ)² + (x₂−μ)² + (x₃−μ)²) / 3 ]  
        ≈ sqrt[ (644.3² + (−3,987.7)² + 3,343.3²) / 3 ]  
        ≈ sqrt[ 27,497,541 / 3 ]  
        ≈ 3,028  

    → **σ ≈ \$3,028 million** across the three maturity buckets.  

2.  Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities as of Jan 26 2025  

    From the “Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities” summary (Note 5, p. 10):  

    Corporate debt securities (Jan 26 ’25)  
      • Amortized cost $18,504   
      • Unrealized gain $  51   
      • Unrealized loss ( 29 )  

    → **Unrealized gain = \$51 million**.  

3.  % increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value  

    From the “Fair Value at Apr 27, 2025 and Jan 26, 2025 (by Pricing Category)” table (Note 6, p. 12):  

    ‑ Level 1 Money market funds  
      • Jan 26 ’25 fair value: 3,760  
      • Apr 27 ’25 fair value: 6,522  
      → Δ = 6,522 – 3,760 = 2,762

    → **Level 1 money market funds rose ~73.5%** over the quarter.  

Finally, management discloses that “gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates” (Note 5, p. 11), placing these movements in the context of a rising-rate environment."
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","Here’s the step-by-step calculation, using the GAAP figures from the sequential quarterly charts:

1. Extract the GAAP operating income numbers (from the “GAAP Operating Income” slide):  
   • Q3 2024: \$113.1 M  
   • Q4 2024: \$ 11.0 M  (impacted by the one-time SAR expense)  
   • Q1 2025: \$176.0 M  

2. Compute the two sequential changes in GAAP operating income:  
   – Q3→Q4 2024:  \$11.0 M – \$113.1 M  =  –\$102.1 M  
   – Q4 2024→Q1 2025: \$176.0 M – \$ 11.0 M  =  +\$165.0 M  

3. Thus, the “acceleration” in GAAP operating income is:  
   +\$165.0 M  –  (–\$102.1 M)  =  +\$267.1 M  

4. Repeat the same steps for GAAP net income (from the “GAAP Net Income” slide):  
   • Q3 2024: \$143.5 M  
   • Q4 2024: \$ 79.0 M  
   • Q1 2025: \$214.0 M  

   – Q3→Q4 2024:  \$79.0 M – \$143.5 M  =  –\$64.5 M  
   – Q4 2024→Q1 2025: \$214.0 M – \$ 79.0 M  =  +\$135.0 M  

   Acceleration in net income =  
   +\$135.0 M  –  (–\$64.5 M)  =  +\$199.5 M  

5. Finally, subtract the two accelerations to see by how much operating-income acceleration exceeded net-income acceleration:  
   \$267.1 M  –  \$199.5 M  =  **\$ 67.6 million**

"For NVIDIA’s quarter ended April 27, 2025, what percentage of its remaining performance obligations for contracts greater than one year was unbilled, and for Palantir in Q1 2025, what percentage of its total remaining performance obligations was classified as long-term under its ASC 606 election?","**Answer:**  

1) **NVIDIA (Quarter ended April 27, 2025)**  
   – From Note 8 (Deferred Revenue) to NVIDIA’s Form 10-Q (page 15), NVIDIA reports:  
     • Remaining performance obligations for contracts > 1 year: $1.8 billion  
     • Of that amount, $160 million “has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue.”  
   – Unbilled % = ($160 million ÷ $1,800 million) × 100 ≈ 8.9%  
   – (See “As of April 27, 2025 … includes $1.6 billion from deferred revenue and $160 million which has not yet been billed…” in Note 8 – Deferred Revenue.)  

2) **Palantir (Q1 2025)**  
   – From Palantir’s “Additional Metrics and Notes” (Appendix slide “Total RPO”), Q1 2025:  
     • Total RPO = $1.90 billion  
     • Long-Term RPO (> 12 months) = $1.00 billion  
   – Long-term % = ($1.00 billion ÷ $1.90 billion) × 100 ≈ 52.6%, rounded to 53%  
   – (Palantir elected the practical expedient under ASC 606 to disclose only short- vs. long-term RPO.)

"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?","Between the TTM periods ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, Palantir’s total global commercial customer base grew from 427 to 622 customers (Δ = 622 – 427 = 195) and its U.S. commercial customer base grew from 262 to 432 customers (Δ = 432 – 262 = 170).  The implied non-U.S. addition is therefore:

  • Non-U.S. customers added = Total growth – U.S. growth = 195 – 170 = 25  
  • % of global growth from non-U.S. = 25 ÷ 195 ≈ 12.8% (≈ 13%)

**Calculation details**  
```text
Total commercial customer growth
  = 622 (TTM Mar 31 ’25) – 427 (TTM Mar 31 ’24)
  = 195

U.S. commercial customer growth
  = 432 (TTM Mar 31 ’25) – 262 (TTM Mar 31 ’24)
  = 170

Non-U.S. commercial customer growth
  = 195 – 170
  = 25

Non-U.S. share of total growth
  = 25 / 195 × 100%
  ≈ 12.8%

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","Below is the analysis of NVIDIA’s near-term operating lease obligation growth (FY 2026–FY 2028) and how it ties to management’s plan to put into service roughly $7.4 billion of new data-center and office leases from Q2 FY 2026 through FY 2030.

**1. Operating lease obligations by fiscal year**  
(See Note 14 – Leases, “Operating Lease Obligations” table, pages 20–21 of the 10-Q)  

| Fiscal Year                                      | 2026¹    | 2027    | 2028    |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------:|--------:|--------:|
| Future minimum lease payments (In millions)      |   $ 274  |  $ 346  |  $ 349  |

¹ “2026 (excluding the first quarter of fiscal year 2026)”  

**2. Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) FY 2026 → FY 2028**  
– Beginning value (FY 2026): $274 million  
– Ending value (FY 2028):   $349 million  
– Number of periods: 2 years  

\[  
  \text{CAGR} \;=\; \bigl(\tfrac{349}{274}\bigr)^{1/2} \;-\; 1  
  \;=\; 1.2737^{0.5}\;-\;1  
  \;\approx\;0.129\;=\;12.9\%  
\]  

So, operating‐lease obligations in the near term have grown at roughly a **13 percent compound annual rate** from FY 2026 through FY 2028.

**3. Relation to the $7.4 billion lease‐commencement plan**  
Immediately below the lease‐obligations table in Note 14, management discloses:  

> “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of $7.4 billion primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  

That $7.4 billion pipeline drives the step-up in obligations you see in FY 2027 and FY 2028. In other words, the ~13% CAGR in FY 26–28 lease obligations reflects the front-loading of those new data-center and office leases beginning in Q2 FY 26 and stretching through FY 30.

"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","Below is a summary of how we arrived at the relative volatility (standard-deviation) ratio and what it tells us:

**1. Underlying data (TTM ended Mar. 31, 2025)**  
– US Commercial Customer Count¹  
  • Mar 2024: 262 → Jun 2024: 295  (+13%)  
  • Jun 2024: 295 → Sep 2024: 321  (+9%)  
  • Sep 2024: 321 → Dec 2024: 382 (+19%)  
  • Dec 2024: 382 → Mar 2025: 432 (+13%)  

– Total Customer Count²  
  • Mar 2024: 554 → Jun 2024: 593  (+7%)  
  • Jun 2024: 593 → Sep 2024: 629  (+6%)  
  • Sep 2024: 629 → Dec 2024: 711  (+13%)  
  • Dec 2024: 711 → Mar 2025: 769  (+8%)  

**2. Quarter-over-quarter growth rate series**  
```text
US Commercial:  [0.13, 0.09, 0.19, 0.13]
Total         :  [0.07, 0.06, 0.13, 0.08]
```

**3. Compute standard deviations**  
(using the population formula σ = √[Σ(x–μ)² / N])  

- US Commercial:  
  μ₁ = (0.13+0.09+0.19+0.13)/4 = 0.135  
  σ₁ = √[( (–0.005)² + (–0.045)² + 0.055² + (–0.005)² ) / 4 ]  
     ≈ √(0.001275) ≈ 0.0357  (3.57%)

- Total:  
  μ₂ = (0.07+0.06+0.13+0.08)/4 = 0.085  
  σ₂ = √[( (–0.015)² + (–0.025)² + 0.045² + (–0.005)² ) / 4 ]  
     ≈ √(0.000725) ≈ 0.0269  (2.69%)

**4. Volatility ratio**  
\[
\frac{σ_{\rm US\_Commercial}}{σ_{\rm Total}}
\;=\;\frac{0.0357}{0.0269}\;\approx\;1.33
\]

**5. What it implies**  
A ratio of ~1.33× means that, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, US commercial customer growth swings about 33% more around its average than overall customer growth does—even though management touts a very strong **+65% Y/Y** increase in US commercial count³. In other words, while the annual trend for US commercial customers is undeniably robust, the quarterly additions are materially more volatile than the company’s total customer-base growth.

NVIDIA’s Q1 FY2026 effective tax rate (Note 4)  
   – Income tax expense was $3.1 billion, or 14.3% of income before taxes, versus the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate (and compared with 13.9% in Q1 FY2025).  
   – The rate was lower than 21% primarily due to:  
     • Tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction  
     • A lower tax benefit on stock-based compensation  
     • Income earned in jurisdictions subject to tax at rates below the U.S. federal rate

2. Palantir’s income tax effect on market-vesting SARs  
   – In its Q1 2025 Appendix (“Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income…”), Palantir applies an estimated long-term annual effective tax rate of 23.0% to its income tax effects related to market-vesting SARs.  
   – Comparative/market context (Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024):  
     • GAAP net income: $214 million vs. $105.5 million  
     • Net income excluding one-time SAR-related expenses: $164.7 million vs. $105.5 million

"In NVIDIA's first quarter of fiscal 2026, by how many percentage points did interest income as a share of gross profit increase year-over-year, and how did that compare to the year-over-year percentage increase in research and development expenses?","Below is the walk‐through for each part of the question:

1.  Interest income as a share of gross profit  
    •  Q1 FY2026 gross profit (Apr 27, 2025): \$26,668 million  
    •  Q1 FY2025 gross profit (Apr 28, 2024): \$20,406 million  
    •  Q1 FY2026 interest income: \$515 million  
    •  Q1 FY2025 interest income: \$359 million  

    Compute the ratio of interest income to gross profit in each year:  
    ```
    Q1 FY26:  515  ÷ 26,668  = 1.93%  
    Q1 FY25:  359  ÷ 20,406  = 1.76%  
    ```  
    The year-over-year increase is 1.93% – 1.76% = **0.17 percentage points**.

2.  Year-over-year increase in R&D expense  
    From the Operating Expenses table (three months ended Apr 27, 2025 vs Apr 28, 2024):  
    •  R&D expense FY26: \$3,989 million  
    •  R&D expense FY25: \$2,720 million  
    •  Change: \$1,269 million  
    •  % Change: **47%** (as reported)  

Answer:   
Interest income as a share of gross profit rose by about **0.17 percentage points** year-over-year, whereas research and development spending jumped **47%** over the same period."

"What is the ratio of the U.S. dollar's share of global central bank foreign exchange reserves in 2024 to the euro's share of SWIFT settlements, and by how many percentage points does the dollar's share of SWIFT trade finance settlements exceed its share of international debt?","The handful of data points in the “Downfall of the U.S. Dollar?” box give us everything we need:

- U.S. dollar = 60 % of global central-bank FX reserves  
- Euro = 6 % of SWIFT settlements  
- U.S. dollar = ≈ 85 % of SWIFT trade-finance settlements  
- U.S. dollar = 65 % of international debt  

From that:

1.   60 % ÷ 6 % = 10 ⇒ a 10 : 1 ratio.  
2.   85 % – 65 % = 20 percentage points.  

So the dollar’s reserve share is ten times the euro’s SWIFT share, and its trade-finance share exceeds its debt share by about 20 points."

**Calculation details**  
- Q1 FY 2025: 69 ÷ 80 = 86.25%

  (i.e. share repurchases were almost three times larger than net investing outflows)  

- Dividends paid: $(244)   
- Payments related to employee stock-plan taxes: $(1,532)

1.  Net share of investors expecting further USD depreciation  
    - “Nearly 70% of investors surveyed think the dollar is ‘overvalued,’ and a net 61%, the highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to depreciate.”¹  

2.  Three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar  
    - “U.S. assets have experienced these simultaneous declines in around 7.5% of trading days over the last three years.”²  

3.  Volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio vs. a USD-domestic bond portfolio (last 20 years)  
    - “A dollar-based investor in an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 2x the volatility of a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years.”³  

Putting it all together:  

• 61% ÷ 7.5% ≃ 8.1×  
• Volatility multiple ≃ 2×  

In other words, the “net share expecting further dollar weakness” outstrips the three-year share of truly stressed (simultaneous down) days by roughly eight to one, versus an unhedged ex-U.S. bond portfolio whose volatility has been only about twice that of a pure U.S. bond portfolio.
