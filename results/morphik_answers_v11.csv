question,answer
"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Below is a summary of the requested metrics, including our work‐up, data sources and calculation methodology.

1. Year-over-Year Growth Rates (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)  
   Data sources (all from Q1 2025 Business Update slides):  
   • Total revenue: 39% Y/Y (634 → 884 $ million)  
   • Total revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts: 44% Y/Y (610 → 879 $ million)  
   • US revenue: 55% Y/Y (406 → 628 $ million)  

   Growth rates (decimal form):  
   g₁ = 0.39,  g₂ = 0.44,  g₃ = 0.55  

2. Standard Deviation of Those Three Growth Rates  
   We treat {g₁,g₂,g₃} as a population.  
   – Mean μ = (0.39+0.44+0.55)/3 = 0.46  
   – Variance σ² = [(0.39–0.46)² + (0.44–0.46)² + (0.55–0.46)²] / 3  
                  = (0.0049 + 0.0004 + 0.0081) / 3  
                  ≈ 0.04467  
   – σ = √0.04467 ≈ 0.0668 → 6.68 percentage points  

3. Quarter-over-Quarter Changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 2023 → Q1 2025)  
   From the “Reconciliation of Rule of 40” appendix:  
   Q2 2023 38%, Q3 2023 46%, Q4 2023 54%, Q1 2024 57%, Q2 2024 64%, Q3 2024 68%, Q4 2024 81%, Q1 2025 83%.  
   QoQ ∆ values (in %-points):  
   • Q3–Q2 = 46–38 = 8  
   • Q4–Q3 = 54–46 = 8  
   • Q1 ’24–Q4 = 57–54 = 3  
   • Q2 ’24–Q1 ’24 = 64–57 = 7  
   • Q3 ’24–Q2 ’24 = 68–64 = 4  
   • Q4 ’24–Q3 ’24 = 81–68 = 13  
   • Q1 ’25–Q4 ’24 = 83–81 = 2  

   Compute population σ of {8,8,3,7,4,13,2}:  
   – Mean Δ¯ = 45/7 ≈ 6.43  
   – Variance = Σ(Δᵢ–Δ¯)² / 7 ≈ 12.245  
   – σ ≈ √12.245 ≈ 3.50 points  

4. Relation to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 Score  
   • The Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score itself is 83% (all‐time high).  
   • The **6.7 pp** stdev across different revenue‐growth measures is modest relative to their average (~46%), indicating consistent top‐line acceleration.  
   • The **3.5 pp** stdev of quarter-to-quarter Rule of 40 changes shows steady improvement with only moderate quarter-to-quarter volatility.  
   • Together, these volatility metrics underscore a smooth, rising trend in Palantir’s combined growth & profitability (Rule of 40), culminating in the record 83% in Q1 2025."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Here’s how you can reconcile Palantir’s operating expense per U.S. commercial customer in Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2025, step by step:

**1. Pull the key line-items from the financials**  
a. Revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts  
   – Q1 2024: \$610.440 million (“Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” table, Appendix)  
   – Q1 2025: \$878.708 million (same table)  

b. Adjusted operating income  
   – Q1 2024: \$226.458 million (“Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin,” Q1 2024 column)  
   – Q1 2025: \$390.710 million (same schedule, Q1 2025 column)  

c. U.S. commercial customer count (TTM ended March 31)  
   – Mar 31 2024: 262 customers (“US Commercial Customer Count,” TTM ended Mar 31 2024 bar)  
   – Mar 31 2025: 432 customers (“US Commercial Customer Count,” TTM ended Mar 31 2025 bar)  

**2. Calculate total operating expense**  
We define “operating expense” here as the excess of revenue (ex-strategic) over adjusted operating income.  

• Q1 2024 Operating Expense  
  = \$610.440 M – \$226.458 M  
  = \$383.982 million  

• Q1 2025 Operating Expense  
  = \$878.708 M – \$390.710 M  
  = \$487.998 million  

**3. Compute operating expense per U.S. commercial customer**  

• Q1 2024  
  = \$383.982 M / 262  
  ≈ \$1.466 million per customer  

• Q1 2025  
  = \$487.998 M / 432  
  ≈ \$1.130 million per customer  

**4. Measure the year-over-year change**  
%Δ = (New – Old) / Old  

= (\$1.130 M – \$1.466 M) / \$1.466 M  
≈ –0.2278, or –22.8%  

**Answer:**  
Operating expense per U.S. commercial customer fell from about \$1.466 M in Q1 2024 to \$1.130 M in Q1 2025, a 22.8% decline year-over-year.

"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in Total Other Assets  
   - As of January 26, 2025, “Total other assets” (long-term) were \$6,425 million.  
   - As of April 27, 2025, “Total other assets” (long-term) were \$6,788 million.  
   - Increase = \$6,788 M – \$6,425 M = **\$363 million**.  
   – (See “Other Assets (Long Term)” table, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets note; April 27 vs. January 26.)

2. Increase in Assumed-Liability Acquisitions  
   - Q1 FY 2025: \$147 million of property, equipment and intangible assets acquired by assuming liabilities.  
   - Q1 FY 2026: \$408 million of the same.  
   - Increase = \$408 M – \$147 M = **\$261 million**.  
   – (See “Property and Equipment” note to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)

3. Intangible-Asset Amortization as a % of Q1 FY 2026 Acquisitions  
   - Q1 FY 2026 intangible-asset amortization expense: \$159 million.  
   - Percentage of \$408 million acquisitions = (159 ÷ 408) × 100 ≈ **38.97 %** (≈ 39 %).  
   – (See “Amortization expense associated with intangible assets” in Note 7.)"
"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","The numbers break down as follows:

1. Fair value of the CoreWeave investment as of April 27, 2025  
   – Note 5 (cash equivalents & marketable securities) discloses that upon its IPO, NVIDIA reclassified its CoreWeave stake into Level-1 marketable securities at a fair value of $1.0 billion.  

2. Reclassification adjustment in Q1 FY26 against non-marketable equity securities  
   – Note 6 (non-marketable equity securities) shows a “Reclassification (1)” line-item of $(843 million) in the three months ended April 27, 2025, representing the write-off of CoreWeave’s prior carrying value as it moved into marketable securities.  

Subtracting the $843 million write-off from the $1,000 million fair value gives:  

     $1,000 million – $843 million = $157 million  

**Answer:** The April 27, 2025 fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment exceeded the Q1 FY26 non-marketable reclassification adjustment by **$157 million**.  

—  
Additional context & outlook  
• Market performance: In Q1 FY26 NVIDIA delivered record results (revenue of $44.1 billion, up 69% YoY; Data Center revenue of $39.1 billion, up 73% YoY), underscoring the surge in AI/cloud demand that underpins CoreWeave’s valuation.  
• Comparative analysis: The $157 million “pop” reflects an ~18.7% uplift of the stake as it moved from an illiquid carrying basis into active trading on public markets.  
• Forward‐looking: With continued AI‐driven growth in GPU services and planned expansions of DGX Cloud/CoreWeave capacity, analysts expect CoreWeave’s valuation to trend higher through FY26, barring macro or regulatory headwinds."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Below is the answer “under the false premise” that the 83% Rule-of-40 in Q1 2025 was computed as:

"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","Here’s how the two Y/Y growth rates compare and the resulting spread:

1. Overall Total Revenue Y/Y Growth (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)  
   - Q1 2024 revenue: \$634 M  
   - Q1 2025 revenue: \$884 M  
   - Growth rate = (884 – 634)/634 ≈ +39%  
   - Source: “Total revenue grew 39% Y/Y…” slide (Financia ls)  

2. Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts Y/Y Growth (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)  
   - Q1 2024 excl. strat. contracts: \$610 M  
   - Q1 2025 excl. strat. contracts: \$879 M  
   - Growth rate = (879 – 610)/610 ≈ +44%  
   - Source: “Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts grew 44% Y/Y…” slide & Appendix (“Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” table)  

3. Difference (“excess” growth when stripping out strategic deals)  
   - 44% minus 39% = 5 percentage points  

Therefore, after excluding strategic commercial contracts, Palantir’s Q1 2025 revenue grew 5 pp faster (44% Y/Y vs. 39% Y/Y)."

**Comment on interest-rate impact:**  
The company specifically notes that “gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates.”  This underscores that the quarter-over-quarter mark-to-market fluctuations (and associated unrealized losses) largely reflect rate movements rather than credit events."
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","Here’s how the two “accelerations” break down (all figures in millions of USD, quarter‐to‐quarter):

1.  GAAP Operating Income (from slide “GAAP Operating Income”):

    • Q3 2024 → Q4 2024 change  
      = \$11.0 – \$113.1  = –\$102.1 M  

    • Q4 2024 → Q1 2025 change  
      = \$176.0 – \$11.0  = +\$165.0 M  

    • Acceleration  
      = (+\$165.0 M) – (–\$102.1 M)  
      = +\$267.1 M  

2.  GAAP Net Income (from slide “GAAP Net Income”):

    • Q3 2024 → Q4 2024 change  
      = \$79.0 – \$143.5  = –\$64.5 M  

    • Q4 2024 → Q1 2025 change  
      = \$214.0 – \$79.0   = +\$135.0 M  

    • Acceleration  
      = (+\$135.0 M) – (–\$64.5 M)  
      = +\$199.5 M  

3.  Difference between the two accelerations:

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","Below is a summary of the growth in NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations from fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2028, and how it ties to management’s plan to begin new data-center and office leases through fiscal 2030.

1.  Operating Lease Obligations by Year (Note 14 – Leases, p. 21)  
    • 2026 (excl. Q1): $ 274 million  
    • 2027: $ 346 million  
    • 2028: $ 349 million  

2.  Two-Year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)  
    We compute CAGR from the 2026 obligation to the 2028 obligation over two years:  
    \[
      \text{CAGR} 
      = \biggl(\frac{\text{Obligation}_{\,2028}}{\text{Obligation}_{\,2026}}\biggr)^{1/2} - 1
      = \biggl(\frac{349}{274}\biggr)^{0.5} - 1
      \approx 1.1297 - 1
      \approx 0.1297 
      \;\Rightarrow\; 13.0\%
    \]  
    In other words, NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations due in 2026–28 rose at roughly a 13 percent annual clip.

3.  Relation to New Lease Commitments  
    On the same page (Note 14), NVIDIA discloses:  
    “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of $7.4 billion, primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  
    Thus, the ~13 percent CAGR in obligations through 2028 reflects only the scheduled maturity profile of existing leases.  Beginning in Q2 2026, an additional $7.4 billion of new data-center and office leases will be layered on top of that base, driving future lease-liability growth well beyond the amounts shown for 2026–28."

All figures come from the “US Commercial Customer Count” and “Customer Count” slides in the Q1’25 Financial Supplement.  

---

## 1. Extract the Q/Q growth rates  

1.1  US Commercial Customer Count (TTM)  
- Mar 31 2024 → Jun 30 2024: 262 → 295   ⇒ +13%  
- Jun 30 2024 → Sep 30 2024: 295 → 321   ⇒ + 9%  
- Sep 30 2024 → Dec 31 2024: 321 → 382   ⇒ +19%  
- Dec 31 2024 → Mar 31 2025: 382 → 432   ⇒ +13%  

   g_US = [0.13, 0.09, 0.19, 0.13]

1.2  Total Customer Count (TTM)  
- Mar 31 2024 → Jun 30 2024: 554 → 593   ⇒ + 7%  
- Jun 30 2024 → Sep 30 2024: 593 → 629   ⇒ + 6%  
- Sep 30 2024 → Dec 31 2024: 629 → 711   ⇒ +13%  
- Dec 31 2024 → Mar 31 2025: 711 → 769   ⇒ + 8%  

   g_tot = [0.07, 0.06, 0.13, 0.08]

---

## 2. Compute population standard deviations  

We treat the four observations as the population for the trailing-12-month series:

σ² = (1/N) ∑(gᵢ − μ)²  
σ = √σ²  

2.1  US commercial  
- Mean μ_US = (0.13+0.09+0.19+0.13)/4 = 0.135  
- Deviations = [−0.005, −0.045, +0.055, −0.005]  
- Squared devs = [2.5e-5, 2.025e-3, 3.025e-3, 2.5e-5] → sum 0.01275  
- Variance σ²_US = 0.01275/4 = 0.0031875  
- σ_US = √0.0031875 ≃ **0.0565** (i.e. 5.65 ppt)  

2.2  Total customers  
- Mean μ_tot = (0.07+0.06+0.13+0.08)/4 = 0.085  
- Deviations = [−0.015, −0.025, +0.045, −0.005]  
- Squared devs = [2.25e-4, 6.25e-4, 2.025e-3, 2.5e-5] → sum 0.00725  
- Variance σ²_tot = 0.00725/4 = 0.0018125  
- σ_tot = √0.0018125 ≃ **0.0426** (i.e. 4.26 ppt)  

---

## 3. Ratio of volatilities  

Ratio = σ_US / σ_tot = 0.0565 / 0.0426 ≃ **1.33**

---

## 4. Interpretation  

– **Ratio ≃ 1.33** means that, over the last four quarters, the quarter-to-quarter swings in US commercial customer additions were about **33% more volatile** than the swings in total customer additions.  
– This is despite management’s focus on a **+65% year-over-year** increase in US commercial customers (from 262 to 432 TTM, as highlighted on the “US Commercial Customer Count” slide).  
– In other words, while US commercial customer count has grown very quickly on a Y/Y basis, it has done so with larger quarterly fluctuations than the overall base of customers—an important nuance for anyone modeling near-term additions.

---

### 1. Adjusted Gross Margin  
**Management claim:** “85% adjusted gross margin”  
**Actual (Appendix slide “Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit & Adjusted Gross Margin”):**  
- Gross Profit (GAAP): \$710,885 thousands  
- + Stock-Based Compensation in Cost of Revenue: +\$15,016 thousands  
= **Adjusted Gross Profit**: \$725,901 thousands  
- Revenue (from Income Statement, not shown on this slide): \$884 million  
→ **Adjusted Gross Margin** = \$725,901 / \$883,855 ≈ **82%**  

**Adjustment logic:** Exclude only stock-based compensation from Cost of Revenue (per slide heading).  
**Reference:** Appendix, “Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit & Adjusted Gross Margin” (Q1 2025 column).

---

### 2. Adjusted Expenses  
**Management claim:** “sub-\$450 million of adjusted expenses”  
**Actual (Appendix slide “Reconciliation of Cost of Revenue and Total Operating Expenses to Adjusted Expenses”):**  
- Total Expenses (GAAP): \$707,807 thousands  
- – Stock-Based Compensation (all functions): –\$155,339 thousands  
- – Employer Payroll Taxes Related to Stock-Based Compensation: –\$59,323 thousands  
= **Adjusted Expenses**: \$493,145 thousands  

**Adjustment logic:** Remove stock-based compensation expense (across COGS, R&D, G&A) and the related employer payroll taxes.  
**Reference:** Appendix, “Reconciliation of Cost of Revenue and Total Operating Expenses to Adjusted Expenses” (Q1 2025 column).

---

### 3. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders  
**Management claim:** “\$220 million of net income attributable to common stockholders”  
**Actual GAAP (Appendix slide “Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings Per Share, Diluted to Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Diluted”):**  
- Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (GAAP): \$214,031 thousands  

*(If you instead want the non-GAAP “Adjusted Net Income” used for EPS:)*  
- + Stock-Based Compensation: +\$155,339 thousands  
- + Employer Payroll Taxes Related to SBC: +\$59,323 thousands  
- – Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: –\$94,288 thousands  
= **Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common, Diluted**: \$334,405 thousands  

**Adjustment logic:**  
- GAAP net income from the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
- To arrive at the non-GAAP diluted net income, add back SBC and related payroll taxes, then gross up/(down) for income-tax effects at an assumed 23% rate.  

**Reference:** Appendix, “Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings Per Share, Diluted to Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Diluted” (Q1 2025 column). For the pure GAAP number, see the first line (“Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders”).

"Which four factors did NVIDIA cite in Note 4 of its Q1 FY2026 financial statements for its effective tax rate being lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, what was that effective tax rate, and what estimated long-term annual effective tax rate did Palantir apply to its income tax effect for market-vesting SARs?","Below is a concise summary of the three items you requested, together with the relevant market‐performance context, year-over-year comparisons and near-term outlook commentary that appear in each company’s Q1 materials.

1. NVIDIA’s Q1 FY 2026 effective tax rate  
   • Reported income tax expense of \$3.1 billion on income before taxes of \$21.6 billion, implying an effective tax rate of 14.3% (versus 13.9% in Q1 FY 2025 and well below the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate).  
   • Note 4 (“Income Taxes”) explicitly attributes the sub-statutory rate primarily to four items (all in the first paragraph under “Our effective tax rates…”):  
     1. Tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction.  
     2. A lower tax benefit on stock-based compensation.  
     3. Income earned in jurisdictions subject to tax rates below the U.S. federal statutory rate.  
     4. The U.S. federal research tax credit.  
   • Market-performance context: Q1 FY 2026 revenue of \$44.1 billion, up 69% y/y, driven by 73% y/y growth in Data Center (to \$39.1 billion) and 42% y/y growth in Gaming. Operating income was \$21.6 billion (49% margin), and the company signaled that, given “current and possible future earnings,” it may release certain state deferred-tax valuation allowances in the near term—an action that would further lower its reported tax rate for the period in which the release occurs.  

2. Palantir’s estimated long-term annual effective tax rate on market-vesting SARs  
   • In Palantir’s Q1 2025 “Appendix” reconciliation of GAAP net income to net income excluding one-time market-vesting SAR expenses, footnote [1] reads:  
     “Income tax effect is based on an estimated long-term annual effective tax rate of 23.0% for the period ended 2024. The Company’s estimated long-term annual effective tax rate excludes certain noncash items, such as stock-based compensation, and is used in order to provide consistency across periods…”  
   • Impact on Q4 2024 numbers: the SAR-related tax adjustment totaled a \$45.6 million benefit (at 23%), boosting “net income when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses” to \$164.7 million versus \$79.0 million GAAP.  
   • Comparative/forward outlook context: Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted earnings per share (diluted) were \$0.13 versus \$0.08 in Q1 2024, supported by a Rule-of-40 score of 83% and an adjusted free-cash-flow margin of 42%. The 23% long-term rate anchors the company’s approach to SARs and is intended to smooth out period-to-period volatility from equity-based compensation.

1.  Stock-based compensation in “All Other” vs. consolidated operating income

    - Consolidated operating income: \$21,638 million  
    → 1,474 / 21,638 ≈ 6.8%

2.  “Other segment items” in Compute & Networking vs. its revenue  
    - Compute & Networking “Other segment items”: \$17,535 million  
    - Compute & Networking revenue: \$39,589 million

"By how many percentage points did the U.S. dollar’s share of SWIFT trade finance settlements exceed its share of global central bank foreign exchange reserves as of December 31, 2024, and how many percentage points per annum is U.S. dollar depreciation projected by J.P. Morgan Asset Management to add to U.S. dollar–based total returns on European and Japanese equity investments over the next 10–15 years?","1. As of December 31, 2024 the U.S. dollar accounted for about 85 percent of SWIFT trade-finance settlements versus roughly 60 percent of global central-bank FX reserves.  That is a gap of 25 percentage points (85 – 60 = 25).

2. J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s 2025 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions project that ongoing U.S.-dollar depreciation will add roughly 1 to 2 percentage points per annum to U.S.-dollar–based total returns on European and Japanese equities over the next 10–15 years.

"For NVIDIA, comparing the quarters ended April 27, 2025 and April 28, 2024, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of “Total revenue” in the Geographic Revenue by customer billing location table lag the year-over-year growth rate of “Deferred revenue additions” in the Deferred Revenue table?","Below are the year-over-year changes for each metric:

1. Total revenue (Geographic Revenue table)  
   – Apr 28, 2024: \$26,044 M  
   – Apr 27, 2025: \$44,062 M  
   – YoY change = (44,062 – 26,044) / 26,044 ≈ 0.69 ⇒ **69%** increase

"Under the Tariff Policy Uncertainty framework described in JPMorgan’s midyear report, what share of the 20 stocks driving 80% of the S&P 500’s year-to-date peak-to-trough losses were AI-exposed, what capex growth rate do analysts pencil in for the four major hyperscalers, and what percentage of the investable software universe is public?","Here’s how JPMorgan breaks it down under its “tariff policy uncertainty” lens (2025 Mid-Year Outlook):

1. AI exposure among the 20 worst S&P 500 decliners  
   - “Twenty companies – nearly two-thirds of them exposed to AI – accounted for 80% of the year-to-date peak-to-trough losses in the S&P 500 before April 2.”¹  
   → ≈ 2/3 of those 20 stocks were AI-linked (about 65–67%).

2. 2025 capex growth penciled in for the four major hyperscalers  
   - “Wall Street analysts are now penciling in nearly 33% capex growth from the four major hyperscalers over 2025 (up from just over 20% at the start of the year).”¹  
   → ≈ 33% y/y capex growth.

3. Public companies as a share of the investable software universe  
   - “Out of nearly 100,000 investable software companies, only ~4,000 are public.”²

"In NVIDIA's first quarter of fiscal 2026, by how many percentage points did interest income as a share of gross profit increase year-over-year, and how did that compare to the year-over-year percentage increase in research and development expenses?","**Answer:**

- In Q1 FY 2026, interest income on a gross-profit basis rose from 359 / 20,406 = 1.76 % in Q1 FY 2025 to 515 / 26,668 = 1.93 % in Q1 FY 2026 – an increase of about 0.17 percentage points (17 basis points).  
- Over the same period, research & development expenses jumped 1,269 / 2,720 ≈ 47 % year-over-year.

**Calculation details:**

1. **Interest income as a share of gross profit**  
   • Q1 FY 2025:  
     – Gross profit = \$20,406 M  
     – Interest income = \$359 M  
     – Share = 359 ÷ 20,406 ≈ 1.76 %  
   • Q1 FY 2026:  
     – Gross profit = \$26,668 M  
     – Interest income = \$515 M  
     – Share = 515 ÷ 26,668 ≈ 1.93 %  
   • Change = 1.93 % − 1.76 % = 0.17 percentage points  

2. **R&D expense increase**  
   • Q1 FY 2025 R&D = \$2,720 M  
   • Q1 FY 2026 R&D = \$3,989 M  
   • Increase = (3,989 − 2,720) ÷ 2,720 ≈ 47 %

2. “AI Diffusion” IFR licensing requirement & deadline for H200/GB200  
   - Issued January 15, 2025, the IFR would have—and in May 2025 the USG indicated it would rescind it—imposed:  
     • A **worldwide licensing requirement** on all products under ECCNs 3A090.a, 4A090.a (and corresponding .z entries), “including all related software and technology,” explicitly covering the H200 and GB200 data-center cards.

"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","Here are the two numbers in question and how they stack up:

1.  Ratio of net-bearish dollar expectations to days of “U.S. stress”  
    - Net share of investors who say the dollar will **continue to depreciate**: 61% (the highest since 2006)¹  
    - Three-year rolling share of trading days in which **U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar all fell**: 7.5%²  
    → 61 / 7.5 ≃ **8.1**  

2.  Volatility multiple of an **unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond** portfolio vs. a **U.S.-dollar domestic** bond portfolio over the last 20 years: **≈ 2×**³  

Putting it together:  
- The market’s net bearishness on the dollar (61% vs. 7.5% “bad‐days”) implies an **8-to-1** ratio,  
- while the actual extra volatility of unhedged ex-U.S. bonds has been only about **2-to-1**.  

In other words, investor scepticism about the dollar is running roughly **four times** higher than the relative volatility premium one would have observed by holding unhedged foreign bonds.
