**4. Contextualizing Q1 2025 Rule of 40 (83%)**  
- The Rule of 40 score of 83% (Q1 2025) is the highest in the eight-quarter series (Appendix).  
- Its **sequential increase** (+2 pp) is **below** the average QoQ change (≈+6.4 pp) and well within the SD (±3.5 pp), indicating the pace of improvement has moderated.  
- Its **absolute level** (83%) **exceeds** the long-run mean (≈57%) by more than **two standard deviations** of the quarter-over-quarter series, underscoring an era-high combination of growth + profitability despite relatively low recent volatility.  

**Summary of Volatility Metrics vs. Q1 2025 Outcome**  
- Revenue‐growth SD across key segments ≈ 6.4 pp around a mean of 46%.  
- QoQ Rule of 40 SD ≈ 3.5 pp around a mean uptick of +6.4 pp.  
- Q1 2025’s Rule of 40 (83%) sits at the apex of the historical trend, with its modest +2 pp gain falling **within** expected quarter-to-quarter dispersion while its level is **well above** the long-term average and benchmark.",INCORRECT,Answers differ significantly in content or numbers

### 1. Source Data

1) **Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts**  
   (Appendix: “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts”)
   - Q1 2024:  
     – Revenue (total): \$634,338 K  
     – Less strategic commercial contracts: \$23,898 K  
     ⇒ **Revenue excl. strategic** = \$610,440 K  
   - Q1 2025:  
     – Revenue (total): \$883,855 K  
     – Less strategic commercial contracts: \$ 5,147 K  
     ⇒ **Revenue excl. strategic** = \$878,708 K  

2) **Adjusted operating income**  
   (Appendix: “Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin”)  
   - Q1 2024: **\$226,458 K**  
   - Q1 2025: **\$390,710 K**  

3) **US commercial customer count**  
   (Slide: “US Commercial Customer Count, TTM ended Mar 31”)  
   - TTM ended Mar 31 2024: **262** customers  
   - TTM ended Mar 31 2025: **432** customers

### 2. Calculations

1) **Operating expense** = (Revenue excl. strategic) – (Adjusted operating income)  
   - Q1 2024:  
     610,440 – 226,458 = **383,982 K**  
   - Q1 2025:  
     878,708 – 390,710 = **487,998 K**  

2) **Operating expense per US commercial customer**  
   = Operating expense ÷ Customer count  
   - Q1 2024:  
     383,982 K ÷ 262 ≃ **1,466 K/customer**  
   - Q1 2025:  
     487,998 K ÷ 432 ≃ **1,130 K/customer**  

3) **Year-over-year change**  
   \[
     \frac{1{,}130 - 1{,}466}{1{,}466}
     = -0.2294
     \approx -23.0\%

"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","The fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceeded the Q1 FY26 non-marketable equity securities reclassification adjustment by $157 million.","**Answer: NVIDIA’s CoreWeave reclassification “pop” in Q1 FY26**  
   
• Fair value of CoreWeave at April 27, 2025 (Note 5):  
    – Footnote to the Level 1 “Publicly-held equity securities” line discloses that NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment, reclassified to marketable status in Q1 FY26, had a fair value of $1 billion as of April 27, 2025.  
   
• Carrying‐value reclassification adjustment (Note 6):  
    – In the “Adjustments to the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities” table, the line “Reclassification” shows a $843 million reduction of long-term other assets for the three months ended April 27, 2025.  
   
• Difference:  
    – $1,000 million (fair value) – $843 million (carrying reduction) = **$157 million**.  
   
**Market‐performance context**  
– Since reclassification, NVIDIA’s publicly-held equity bucket swelled to $1.251 billion (Level 1) from $381 million as of January 26, 2025, driven largely by CoreWeave’s debut price performance.  
– Net unrealized losses on publicly-held securities were $222 million in Q1 FY26 (vs. immaterial in prior year), reflecting fair-value volatility at CoreWeave and ARM.  

**Comparative analysis**  
– CoreWeave’s $1 billion market value exceeded its last carried basis ($843 million) by 19 %.  
– By contrast, net additions to non-marketable securities were $649 million and realized/unrealized gains only $63 million in Q1 FY26.  

**Outlook & forecast**  
– Management highlights robust demand for data-center acceleration (A100/H200) and DGX Cloud, supporting further upward re-valuation of CoreWeave.  
– Given strong uptake of NVIDIA-accelerated HPC services, the fair value of CoreWeave (a GPU-as-a-service provider) is expected to continue outpacing its historical cost basis, barring broader market pullbacks.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)

3.  Calculation Method  
   • These line items are taken directly from the “Net cash provided by operating activities” line in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  
   • The year-over-year dollar change is computed by subtracting Q1 FY 2025’s $15,345 million from Q1 FY 2026’s $27,414 million.  

4.  Items Driving the Increase (see MD&A, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” page 28)  
   NVIDIA’s MD&A states:  
   “Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, due to higher revenue and timing of cash collections.”  

Summary  
•  Net cash provided by operating activities rose by $12.1 billion year-over-year (from $15,345 million to $27,414 million).  
•  MD&A cites two principal drivers of the increase:  
   1. Higher revenue in the quarter; and

   - Q4 2024: \$11.0 M  
   - Q1 2025: \$176.0 M

   - Q3→Q4 = \$11.0 M − \$113.1 M = –\$102.1 M  
   - Q4→Q1 = \$176.0 M − \$11.0 M = +\$165.0 M

**Conclusion:**  
After the one-time SAR expense in Q4 2024, the bounce-back in GAAP operating income accelerated by \$267.1 million versus \$199.5 million for GAAP net income, so the operating-income acceleration outpaced net-income acceleration by **\$67.6 million**.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)

1.  Operating Lease Obligations by Fiscal Year  
    (Note 14 – “Leases,” Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, unaudited)  

    • FY 2026 (excl. Q1): \$ 274 million

    “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of \$7.4 billion primarily of data-center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  

    In other words, while the existing lease portfolio grew at roughly a 12.8% annual clip from FY 26 to FY 28, management is simultaneously planning to add another \$7.4 billion (undiscounted) of data-center and office leases over Q2 FY 26 through FY 30. Those new commitments will build on—and materially exceed—the historic CAGR trend in operating lease obligations.

1.  Extracted customer counts (trailing-twelve-month basis)  
    •  U.S. Commercial Customer Count (from slide “US Commercial Customer Count”):  
       Q1 ’24 = 262 → Q2 ’24 = 295 → Q3 ’24 = 321 → Q4 ’24 = 382 → Q1 ’25 = 432  
    •  Total Customer Count (from slide “Customer Count”):  
       Q1 ’24 = 554 → Q2 ’24 = 593 → Q3 ’24 = 629 → Q4 ’24 = 711 → Q1 ’25 = 769  

2.  Compute QoQ growth rates  
    US Commercial:  
    – Q2 vs Q1: (295–262)/262 ≈ 0.126 = 12.6%  
    – Q3 vs Q2: (321–295)/295 ≈ 0.088 = 8.8%  
    – Q4 vs Q3: (382–321)/321 ≈ 0.190 = 19.0%  
    – Q1 ’25 vs Q4 ’24: (432–382)/382 ≈ 0.131 = 13.1%  
    Total Customers:  
    – Q2 vs Q1: (593–554)/554 ≈ 0.070 = 7.0%  
    – Q3 vs Q2: (629–593)/593 ≈ 0.061 = 6.1%  
    – Q4 vs Q3: (711–629)/629 ≈ 0.130 = 13.0%  
    – Q1 ’25 vs Q4 ’24: (769–711)/711 ≈ 0.082 = 8.2%  

3.  Standard deviations of those four observations  
    Using the “population” formula (σ = sqrt[Σ(xᵢ–μ)²/N]):  
    •  US Commercial growth rates {13%, 9%, 19%, 13%} → σ≈3.6%  
    •  Total Customer growth rates {7%, 6%, 13%, 8%} → σ≈2.7%  

4.  Ratio of volatilities  
    σ(U.S. commercial) / σ(total customers) ≈ 3.6% / 2.7% ≈ 1.33×  

5.  Interpretation  
    Even though management highlights a very strong +65% year-over-year increase in U.S. commercial customer count (slide “US commercial continues to accelerate in Q1 2025…”), the quarter-to-quarter additions have been about one-third more volatile on a relative basis versus the entire customer base.

1. NVIDIA’s Four Key Rate-Reduction Factors (Note 4, Q1 FY 2026)  
   NVIDIA reported a 14.3% effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2026—well below the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate.  In Note 4, management explained that this gap was “primarily due to”:
   -  Tax benefits from the **foreign-derived intangible income deduction**  
   -  The **tax effect of stock-based compensation**  
   -  **Income earned in jurisdictions** with tax rates below the U.S. federal rate  
   -  The **U.S. federal research tax credit**¹  

   — Comparative context:  
   • Q1 FY 2026 income before tax grew 49.7% of revenue (vs. 66.5% in Q1 FY 2025), driven by 69% Y/Y revenue growth to \$44.1 billion and robust Data Center (+73% Y/Y) and Graphics (+42% Y/Y) demand.  
   • Gross margin (60.5%) reflected a \$4.5 billion inventory charge; operating expenses rose 44% Y/Y.  
   • Looking forward, NVIDIA may release valuation allowances on state deferred tax assets “in the near term,” which—when recognized—would further reduce expense; timing and amounts depend on evolving earnings and asset analyses.  

2. Palantir’s Long-Term Tax Rate Assumption for Market-Vesting SARs  
   In reconciling its GAAP net income to adjusted net income (Appendix), Palantir applies an **estimated long-term annual effective tax rate of 23.0%** to the income-tax effect of its one-time market-vesting SAR awards.²  

   — Market performance & outlook:  
   • Q1 2025 GAAP net income was \$214 million (up from \$105.5 million in Q1 2024), and adjusted net income (ex-SAR) was \$334.4 million.  
   • US commercial revenue grew 55% Y/Y and 13% Q/Q to \$628 million; US government revenue was up 45% Y/Y; closed 139 deals ≥\$1 million.  
   • Rule of 40 metric reached 83%; adjusted free cash flow margin was 42% (\$370 million), and adjusted operating margin 44% (\$391 million).  
   • Palantir’s tax-rate consistency policy “excludes certain non-cash items (e.g., stock-based compensation)” to smooth period-to-period volatility and align with long-term planning.

"According to Nvidia’s cash flow statement, when it was incorrectly claimed that net cash used in investing activities exceeded share repurchases for the period, what were the actual figures for net cash used in investing activities versus share repurchases and how did dividends paid compare to payments for employee stock plan taxes?","Net cash used in investing activities was $5,216 million, which was less than the $14,095 million spent on share repurchases, and dividends paid were $244 million compared to $1,532 million of payments for employee stock plan taxes.","Here are the actual numbers for the quarter ended April 27, 2025, straight from NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated statement of cash flows (in millions):

- Net cash used in investing activities … $(5,216)  
- Payments for repurchases of common stock … (14,095)  

So, rather than “investing activities” exceeding share buybacks, buybacks were almost three times larger than investing outflows.

In the financing section of the same period:

- Dividends paid … $(244)  
- Payments related to employee stock‐plan taxes … (1,532)  

Thus, payments for stock‐plan tax withholding ($1,532 M) were over six times the cash dividends paid ($244 M).",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)
"On a quarter-over-quarter basis, by how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s net working capital change, by how many millions of dollars did its retained earnings increase, and what percentage of that retained earnings increase was consumed by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets?","NVIDIA’s net working capital increased by $1,314 million, retained earnings increased by $4,120 million, and purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets consumed 29.8% of that retained earnings increase.","**Answer:**

- **Net Working Capital**  
  – As of Jan 26, 2025:  
    · Current assets = \$80,126 million  
    · Current liabilities = \$18,047 million  
    ⇒ NWC₁ = 80,126 − 18,047 = \$62,079 million  
  – As of Apr 27, 2025:  
    · Current assets = \$89,935 million  
    · Current liabilities = \$26,542 million  
    ⇒ NWC₂ = 89,935 − 26,542 = \$63,393 million  
  – **Change** = 63,393 − 62,079 = **+\$1,314 million**

- **Retained Earnings**  
  – Jan 26, 2025: \$68,038 million  
  – Apr 27, 2025: \$72,158 million  
  – **Increase** = 72,158 − 68,038 = **+\$4,120 million**

"Under footnote 11 in J.P. Morgan’s midyear report article “IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?” what is the difference in percentage points between the net percentage of investors expecting continued dollar depreciation and the year-to-date share of trading days in 2025 with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar as defined by the market-credibility metric in the “Tracking the market’s perception of the dollar” section?",56 percentage points.,"The net share of investors expecting further dollar depreciation (per footnote 11) is 61%, while the “market-credibility” metric shows only a 5% share of trading days in 2025 with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar.  The difference is therefore 56 percentage points (61% – 5% = 56 pp).

"In Q1 FY26, following the USG’s April 9, 2025 export licensing requirements that diminished demand for H20 products, what percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales did NVIDIA’s related excess inventory charge represent, and by how many percentage points did that percentage exceed Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin?",The charge represented 97.8% of pre-licensing H20 sales and exceeded Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin by 53.8 percentage points.,"Here’s the math in two steps:

1.  The April 9, 2025 USG licensing notice forced NVIDIA to write‐off $4.5 billion of H20 inventory against roughly $4.6 billion of pre-license H20 sales in Q1 FY26.  
   – 4.5 ÷ 4.6 ≈ 97.8 %

2.  Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin (as disclosed in its earnings presentation) was about 35 %.  

So the excess‐inventory charge equaled roughly 98 % of the H20 run-rate, which is about a 63 percentage-point premium over Palantir’s 35 % adjusted operating margin.

"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","The net expectation-to-market-stress ratio is 8.13×, which is 4.07× the 2.0× volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio versus a U.S. domestic bond portfolio.","Here’s the comparison in a nutshell:

1. Net share of investors expecting further USD depreciation  
   – “A net 61%, the highest share since 2006, expect the dollar to continue to depreciate.”¹  

2. Three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar  
   – “U.S. assets have experienced these simultaneous declines in around 7.5% of trading days over the last three years.”²  

3. Volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio vs. a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio (20-year history)  
   – “An unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 2 × the volatility of a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years.”³  

Ratio of (1) to (2):  
   61% ÷ 7.5% ≈ 8.1  

Comparison to (3):  
   – The market’s bearishness ratio (~8 : 1) is roughly four times larger than the 2 × volatility differential of a currency-unhedged bond strategy.
