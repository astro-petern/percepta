"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Below is a back‐of‐the‐envelope calculation using the “revenue ex strategic commercial contracts” and “adjusted operating income” lines from the Q1 2025 appendix and the US commercial customer counts from the top‐line slides:

1. Q1 2024  
   – Revenue excl. strategic contracts: \$610.4 M  
   – Adj. operating income: \$226.5 M  
   – Implied operating expense = 610.4 – 226.5 = \$383.9 M  
   – US commercial customers (TTM Mar 31, 2024): 262  
   – Op­ex per customer = 383.9 ÷ 262 ≈ \$1.466 M

2. Q1 2025  
   – Revenue excl. strategic contracts: \$878.7 M  
   – Adj. operating income: \$391.0 M  
   – Implied operating expense = 878.7 – 391.0 = \$487.7 M  
   – US commercial customers (TTM Mar 31, 2025): 432  
   – Op­ex per customer = 487.7 ÷ 432 ≈ \$1.129 M

3. Year-over-year change  
   – Change in op­ex per customer = (1.129 – 1.466) ÷ 1.466 ≈ –0.23 ⇒ –23%

Answer: Operating expense per US commercial customer fell by roughly 23% year over year."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in total other assets  
   – Apr 27, 2025 “Total other assets”: $ 6,788 million  
   – Jan 26, 2025 “Total other assets”: $ 6,425 million  
   → Increase of $6,788 – $6,425 = $ 363 million  

2. Increase in assumed-liability acquisitions (PPE & intangibles)  
   – Q1 FY 2026: $ 408 million  
   – Q1 FY 2025: $ 147 million

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","**Answer: The combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net grew faster—by about 23 percentage points.**

**Calculation details**

1.   Cash flows from operating activities (Table “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows”):  
   Stock-based compensation expense  
      Apr 27, 2025: \$1,474 M  
      Apr 28, 2024: \$1,011 M  
   Depreciation and amortization  
      Apr 27, 2025: \$ 611 M  
      Apr 28, 2024: \$ 410 M  
   Combined (2025 vs. 2024):  
      Current = 1,474 + 611 = 2,085 M  
      Prior  = 1,011 + 410 = 1,421 M  
   Year-over-year change = (2,085 – 1,421)/1,421 ≈ 46.7%

2.   Consolidated statements of income & comprehensive income:  
   Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities  
      Apr 27, 2025:  +\$ 139 M  
      Apr 28, 2024: –\$ 128 M  
   Total other income (expense), net  
      Apr 27, 2025:  +\$ 272 M  
      Apr 28, 2024:  +\$ 370 M  
   Combined (2025 vs. 2024):  
      Current = 139 + 272 = 411 M  
      Prior  = (– 128) + 370 = 242 M  
   Year-over-year change = (411 – 242)/242 ≈ 69.8%

3.   Comparison of growth rates:  
      Stock-based comp + depr. amort. grew ≈ 46.7%  
      Unrealized gains + other income grew ≈ 69.8%  
   Difference ≈ 69.8% – 46.7% ≈ 23.1 percentage points  

Therefore, the combined unrealized-gain/other-income line grew about 70% year-over-year versus about 47% for stock-based comp + depreciation/amortization, a gap of roughly **23 percentage points**."
"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","1. Actual year-over-year change  
   – Net cash provided by operating activities for Q1 FY 2026 was $27,414 million versus $15,345 million for Q1 FY 2025, an increase of $12,069 million.  

2. Items driving the shift

"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","Here’s the “back‐of‐the‐envelope” work, using the GAAP line items from the Q3 2024→Q4 2024 and Q4 2024→Q1 2025 bridges:

1. GAAP Net Income  
   • Q3 2024 = \$143.5 M  
   • Q4 2024 = \$ 79.0 M  
   • Q1 2025 = \$214.0 M  

   – Q3→Q4 change = 79.0 – 143.5 = –\$64.5 M  
   – Q4→Q1 change = 214.0 – 79.0 = +\$135.0 M  
   – Acceleration = (+135.0) – (–64.5) = +\$199.5 M  

2. GAAP Operating Income  
   • Q3 2024 = \$113.1 M  
   • Q4 2024 = \$ 11.0 M  
   • Q1 2025 = \$176.0 M  

   – Q3→Q4 change = 11.0 – 113.1 = –\$102.1 M  
   – Q4→Q1 change = 176.0 – 11.0 = +\$165.0 M  
   – Acceleration = (+165.0) – (–102.1) = +\$267.1 M  

3. Difference in accelerations  
   – \$267.1 M (Op Inc accel.) minus \$199.5 M (Net Inc accel.) ≃ **\$67.6 million**  

So, the operating‐income acceleration exceeded the net‐income acceleration by about \$68 million."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many percentage points did NVIDIA’s excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of its total accrued and other current liabilities change, and as of April 27, 2025, what percentage of its net long-term carrying amount of debt are its outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations?","**Answer:**

1. **Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a % of total accrued & other current liabilities**  
   – As of Jan 26, 2025:  
     Excess obligations = \$2,095 million  
     Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$11,737 million  
     → 2,095 / 11,737 = 17.85%  
   – As of Apr 27, 2025:  
     Excess obligations = \$4,310 million  
     Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$19,211 million  
     → 4,310 / 19,211 = 22.44%  
   – **Change** = 22.44% – 17.85% ≈ **+4.6 percentage points**

2. **Outstanding inventory purchase & long-term supply and capacity obligations as a % of net long-term carrying debt (Apr 27, 2025)**  
   – Obligations (Note 11) = \$29.8 billion  
   – Net long-term carrying amount of debt (Note 10) = \$8.464 billion

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","The table of future minimum operating‐lease obligations (Note 14) shows:

• FY 2026 (excl. Q1): \$274 million  
• FY 2027: \$346 million  
• FY 2028: \$349 million  

If you take \$274 m → \$349 m over two years, the compound annual growth rate is:

CAGR = (349 / 274)^(1/2) – 1 ≈ (1.2745)^(0.5) – 1 ≈ 12.9%

In other words, NVIDIA’s annual lease‐obligation run‐rate grew by roughly 13% per year between FY 2026 and FY 2028.

Why does this matter?  Immediately below that table, NVIDIA discloses:

  “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of \$7.4 billion primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”

So the ~13% annual increase in lease obligations through FY 28 is merely the opening act.  Management is planning to layer on an incremental \$7.4 billion of new data-center and office leases from Q2 FY 26 through FY 30, which will drive its total operating‐lease footprint substantially higher over the next five years."
"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","Here’s a quick back‐of‐the‐envelope look at the four quarter-to-quarter changes in each series:

• US Commercial Customer Count Q/Q growth rates (TTM-ended):  
  – Q2 ’24 vs Q1 ’24: +9%  
  – Q3 ’24 vs Q2 ’24: +7%  
  – Q4 ’24 vs Q3 ’24: +15%  
  – Q1 ’25 vs Q4 ’24: +9%  

• Total Customer Count Q/Q growth rates (TTM-ended):  
  – Q2 ’24 vs Q1 ’24: +7%  
  – Q3 ’24 vs Q2 ’24: +6%  
  – Q4 ’24 vs Q3 ’24: +13%  
  – Q1 ’25 vs Q4 ’24: +8%  

If you treat those four observations in each series as a population, the standard deviations work out to:  
  σ(US Comm.) ≃ 3.0 pp  
  σ(Total)   ≃ 2.7 pp  

The ratio is therefore about 3.0/2.7 ≃ 1.1.  

Interpretation  
– A ratio of ~1.1 means the US commercial segment’s quarter-to-quarter growth has been ~10 % “noisier” than the company-wide customer base.  
– In absolute terms, both series only swing ±3 pp or so quarter-to-quarter, which is tiny next to the 65 % year-over-year expansion rate management is highlighting. In other words, while the commercial cohort is slightly more jumpy than the aggregate, its underlying growth remains very smooth relative to its blistering Y/Y pace."
"For NVIDIA, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, what were the dollar increase in Interest income and the dollar decline in Other income (expense), net, and what was the primary driver identified for the change in Other income (expense), net?","1.

"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the change in Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs expressed as a percentage of the total scheduled long-term debt principal across all maturity buckets?","Between the two dates, Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs went from \$37 million at January 26, 2025 to \$36 million at April 27, 2025—a \$1 million decrease.  

Total scheduled long-term debt principal across all maturities is  
1,000 + 1,250 + 1,500 + 1,250 + 1,000 + 2,000 +  500 = \$8,500 million.  

Change as a percentage of that principal =  
( \$1 million / \$8,500 million ) × 100% ≈ 0.0118%.  

So the unamortized discount decreased by about 0.012% of total principal.

"Which four factors did NVIDIA cite in Note 4 of its Q1 FY2026 financial statements for its effective tax rate being lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, what was that effective tax rate, and what estimated long-term annual effective tax rate did Palantir apply to its income tax effect for market-vesting SARs?","Here’s the detail pulled straight from NVIDIA’s Note 4 and Palantir’s appendix footnote:

1. NVIDIA’s Q1 FY 2026 effective rate (14.3%) was below the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily because of four items:
   - the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction

"In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, what was NVIDIA's interest coverage ratio (interest income divided by interest expense) and what percentage of its net interest spread did net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities—driven by fair value volatility in investments including CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.—consume?","In Q1 of fiscal 2026 (the three months ended April 27, 2025), NVIDIA reported:  

- Interest income of $515 million and interest expense of $63 million (from the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income, “Interest income” and “Interest expense”).  
  → Interest coverage ratio = 515 / 63 ≈ 8.2×  

- Net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities of $222 million (Note 5, “Net unrealized losses on investments in publicly-held equity securities held at period end were $222 million…”).  
  Net interest spread = 515 – 63 = $452 million  
  → Losses as a % of that spread = 222 / 452 ≈ 49%  

So, NVIDIA’s interest coverage was about 8.2× and its fair-value‐driven equity‐security losses consumed roughly 49% of its net interest spread."
"What is the unweighted arithmetic average of Palantir’s Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score and its year-over-year growth rates in US revenue, US commercial revenue, total revenue, and total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts?","Here are the five Q1 2025 metrics in question (all year-over-year % growth except the Rule of 40 score):

   - Net share of investors who expect further USD depreciation: 61 %¹  
   - Three-year rolling share of trading days when U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar all fall: ≃ 7.5 %²  
   → Ratio ≃ 61 % ÷ 7.5 % ≃ 8.1  

2. Bond‐portfolio volatilities over the past 20 years  
   - An unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio has been about 2× as volatile as a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio.³  

Comparison  
• The sentiment-to-“all-three”-down‐day ratio (~ 8 : 1) is roughly four times larger than the 2× volatility multiple.

2 Bloomberg data as of April 30, 2025: U.S. assets have seen simultaneous declines ≃ 7.5 % of trading days over the last three years (“Tracking the market’s perception of the dollar,” p. 22).  
3 “Is this the downfall of the U.S. dollar?” (p. 21): “a dollar-based investor in an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 2× the volatility of a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years.”"
