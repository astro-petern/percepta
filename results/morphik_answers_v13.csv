"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","**1. Year-over-year growth rates (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)**  
- Total revenue: 634 M → 884 M ⇒ +39%  
- Total rev ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts: 610.4 M → 878.7 M ⇒ +44%  
- US revenue: 406 M → 628 M ⇒ +55%  

**2. Volatility across those three growth rates**  
Mean of {39%, 44%, 55%} = 46.0%  
– Population σ = √[ ((–7)² + (–2)² + 9²) / 3 ] ≈ 6.7 ppt  
– Sample σ = √[ ((–7)² + (–2)² + 9²) / 2 ] ≈ 8.2 ppt  

So roughly a 7–8 ppt standard deviation across the three Y-o-Y rates.

**3. Quarter-over-quarter changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 2023 → Q1 2025)**  
Ro40 by quarter:  
 Q2 ’23 38%, Q3 ’23 46%, Q4 ’23 54%, Q1 ’24 57%, Q2 ’24 64%, Q3 ’24 68%, Q4 ’24 81%, Q1 ’25 83%  

Differences QΔ: +8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2  
– Mean Δ ≈ 6.4 ppt  
– Population σ ≈ 3.5 ppt  
– Sample σ ≈ 3.8 ppt  

**4. Relation to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score**  
– Despite moderate volatility in individual revenue-growth rates (σ ≈ 7–8 ppt) and in quarter-to-quarter Ro 40 changes (σ ≈ 3.5 ppt), Palantir’s Rule of 40 has trended steadily upward to 83% in Q1 2025—more than double the 40% benchmark—reflecting both accelerating growth and strong operating leverage."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Here’s how the year-over-year change breaks down:

1. From the Appendix (Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts):  
   • Q1 2024 revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts = \$610.44 M  
   • Q1 2025 revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts = \$878.71 M  

2. From the Appendix (Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income):  
   • Q1 2024 adjusted operating income = \$226.46 M  
   • Q1 2025 adjusted operating income = \$390.71 M  

3. Compute operating expense (revenue less adjusted operating income):  
   • Q1 2024 operating expense = \$610.44 M – \$226.46 M = \$383.98 M  
   • Q1 2025 operating expense = \$878.71 M – \$390.71 M = \$488.00 M  

4. From the US Commercial Customer Count slide:  
   • TTM ended March 31, 2024 customers = 427  
   • TTM ended March 31, 2025 customers = 622  

5. Operating expense per customer:  
   • Q1 2024 = \$383.98 M / 427 ≈ \$0.900 M per customer  
   • Q1 2025 = \$488.00 M / 622 ≈ \$0.785 M per customer  

6. Percentage change:  
   (0.785 – 0.900) / 0.900 ≈ –0.128 ⇒ –12.8%

Answer: Operating expense per US commercial customer declined by about 13% year-over-year from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in total other assets  
   – As of January 26, 2025 “Total other assets” were $6,425 million, and as of April 27, 2025 they were $6,788 million (Note 5).  
   – Increase = $6,788 million – $6,425 million = **$363 million**  

2. Increase in assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets, Q1 FY 2026 vs. Q1 FY 2025  
   – Q1 FY 2026: $408 million  
   – Q1 FY 2025: $147 million (Note “Property and Equipment”)  
   – Increase = $408 million – $147 million = **$261 million**  

3. Intangible-asset amortization as a percentage of Q1 FY 2026 assumed-liability acquisitions  
   – Q1 FY 2026 intangible amortization = $159 million (Note 7)  
   – As a % of $408 million = (159 / 408) × 100 ≈ **39 %**

"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Here are the numbers under the (false) assumption that Rule of 40 = adjusted free-cash-flow margin + U.S. government revenue Q/Q growth:

• Adjusted free-cash-flow margin: 42%  
  – “Adjusted free cash flow of $370 million; 42% margin.” (Q1 2025 Highlights)  

• U.S. government revenue Q/Q growth: +9%  
  – “U.S. government revenue grew +45% Y/Y and +9% Q/Q to $373 million.” (Q1 2025 Highlights)  

• Quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury securities: $5.4 billion  
  – “We ended Q1 2025 with $5.4 B in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities and no debt.”  

• Number of deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter: 139 deals  
  – “Closed 139 deals of at least $1 million …” (Q1 2025 Highlights)  

• U.S. Commercial Customer Count (TTM ended Mar 31, 2025): 432 customers  
  – “US Commercial Customer Count … TTM ended Mar 31, 2025: 432 (+65% Y/Y, +13% Q/Q).”"
"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","Below are the back-of-the-envelope calculations (all amounts in millions):

1.  Cash-flow line items (Operating CF):  
    – Stock-based compensation (“SBC”)  
      • Apr 27, 2025: $ 1,474  
      • Apr 28, 2024: $ 1,011  
    – Depreciation & amortization (“D&A”)  
      • Apr 27, 2025: $   611  
      • Apr 28, 2024: $  410  
    – Combined SBC + D&A  
      • 1Q ’26 (2025): $ 1,474 + 611 = 2,085  
      • 1Q ’25 (2024): $ 1,011 + 410 = 1,421  
    – Year-over-year growth  
      • (2,085 – 1,421) / 1,421 ≈ 0.467 ⇒ 46.7 %

2.  Income-statement line items:  
    a) Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities (OCI):  
      • Apr 27, 2025: $   139  
      • Apr 28, 2024: $(128)  
    b) Total other income (expense), net (IS):  
      • Apr 27, 2025: $   272  
      • Apr 28, 2024: $   370  
    – Combined AFS unrealized gain + Other income  
      • 1Q ’26: 139 + 272 = 411  
      • 1Q ’25: (128) + 370 = 242  
    – Year-over-year growth  
      • (411 – 242) / 242 ≈ 0.698 ⇒ 69.8 %

3.  Comparison of growth rates:  
    – Cash-flow adjustments grew ~46.7 % YoY  
    – AFS unrealized + Other income grew ~69.8 % YoY  
    – The latter outpaced the former by ~23.1 percentage points (69.8 % – 46.7 %).

"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","Net cash from operations in Q1 FY 2026 was $27,414 million versus $15,345 million in Q1 FY 2025—a year-over-year increase of $12,069 million.  Management attributed the swing to higher revenue and the timing of cash collections."
"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","The Q1 2025 slides show:

- “Total revenue grew 39% Y/Y…”  
- “Total revenue excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts grew 44% Y/Y…”

44% − 39% = 5%

So, the ex-Strategic-Commercial-Contracts growth rate exceeded overall revenue growth by 5 percentage points."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Here are the three answers (all figures in millions, except percentages):

1. Standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value by maturity  
   – Estimated fair values at Jan 26, 2025 vs. Apr 27, 2025:  
     • < 1 year: 18,450 → 25,781 Δ = +7,331  
     • 1–5 years: 23,656 → 26,355 Δ = +2,699  
     • Total: 42,106 → 52,136 Δ = +10,030  
   – Mean Δ = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030) / 3 ≈ 6,686.7  
   – Population σ = √[ ( (7,331−6,686.7)² + (2,699−6,686.7)² + (10,030−6,686.7)² ) / 3 ]  
               ≈ √(27,499,558 / 3) ≈ 3,028  
   → Standard deviation ≈ \$3,028 million

2. Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities at January 26, 2025  
   – From the Jan 26, 2025 marketable-securities roll-forward:  
     “Corporate debt securities  Amortized cost \$18,504   Unrealized Gain \$51   Unrealized Loss (29) …”  
   → Unrealized gain = \$51 million

3. % increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value  
   – Level 1 money-market-funds fair value:  Jan 26, 2025 = \$3,760 million  
                                        Apr 27, 2025 = \$6,522 million  
   – Increase = \(6,522 − 3,760) / 3,760 ≈ 0.7346 → 73.5%  

(Per the disclosures, gross unrealized losses in debt securities were driven primarily by changes in interest rates.)"
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","1. From the GAAP Net Income chart:  
   - Q3 2024 → Q4 2024 change: \$79.0 M − \$143.5 M = −\$64.5 M  
   - Q4 2024 → Q1 2025 change: \$214.0 M − \$79.0 M = +\$135.0 M  
   - Acceleration in Net Income = \$135.0 M − (−\$64.5 M) = **\$199.5 M**  

2. From the GAAP Operating Income chart:  
   - Q3 2024 → Q4 2024 change: \$11.0 M − \$113.1 M = −\$102.1 M  
   - Q4 2024 → Q1 2025 change: \$176.0 M − \$11.0 M = +\$165.0 M  
   - Acceleration in Operating Income = \$165.0 M − (−\$102.1 M) = **\$267.1 M**  

3. Difference in accelerations = \$267.1 M − \$199.5 M = **\$67.6 million**."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many percentage points did NVIDIA’s excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of its total accrued and other current liabilities change, and as of April 27, 2025, what percentage of its net long-term carrying amount of debt are its outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations?","1. Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a % of total accrued and other current liabilities  
   • Jan 26, 2025: 2,095 / 11,737 = 17.9%  
   • Apr 27, 2025: 4,310 / 19,211 = 22.4%  
   → Increase of 22.4% − 17.9% ≈ 4.5 percentage points  

2. Outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply & capacity obligations as a % of net long-term carrying debt (Apr 27, 2025)  
   • Obligations: $29.8 billion (Note 11)  
   • Net long-term carrying debt: $8.464 billion (Note 10)

1. NVIDIA (Q1 FY26 ended April 27, 2025)  
   – Total remaining performance obligations with terms > 1 year: $1.8 billion  
   – Unbilled portion: $160 million

"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?","Between the TTM ended March 31, 2024 and the TTM ended March 31, 2025:

• Global commercial customers grew from 427 to 622, a net increase of 195.  
  (Source: “Commercial Customer Count” slide)

• U.S. commercial customers grew from 262 to 432, a net increase of 170.  
  (Source: “US Commercial Customer Count” slide)

Therefore:

• Non-U.S. commercial customers = 195 – 170 = 25 net additions  
• As a percentage of total global commercial growth:  
 25 / 195 ≈ 12.8% (≈ 13%)"
"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","1. Growth of Operating Lease Obligations, FY 2026–28  
   From the “Operating Lease Obligations” schedule (Note 14), NVIDIA’s future lease commitments scheduled by fiscal year are:  
   - FY 2026 (ex Q1): \$ 274 million  
   - FY 2027: \$ 346 million  
   - FY 2028: \$ 349 million  

   The two-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from \$ 274 million to \$ 349 million is:  

   CAGR = (349 / 274)^(1/2) – 1 ≈ 1.1285 – 1 ≈ 0.1285 ⇒ **12.9 % p.a.**  

2. Relation to Future Leasing Plans  
   In the very next paragraph of Note 14, NVIDIA discloses that  
   > “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of \$ 7.4 billion primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  

   In other words, the ~13 % annual growth in existing operating-lease commitments between FY 2026 and FY 2028 is just the opening act for a much larger build-out.  Management is already planning to layer on another \$ 7.4 billion of new data-center and office leases from Q2 FY 2026 through FY 2030 to support its ongoing infrastructure expansion."
"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","Below is a quick back‐of‐the‐envelope calculation of the quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) customer-count growth standard deviations for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, and the ratio between the U.S. Commercial cohort and Total customers:

1. Extract the QoQ growth rates from the TTM bar charts  
   • U.S. Commercial customer count (TTM ended Mar 31 2024 → Jun 30 2024 → Sep 30 2024 → Dec 31 2024 → Mar 31 2025):  
     262 → 295 → 321 → 382 → 432  
     QoQ % changes: +13%, +9%, +19%, +13%  
   • Total customer count (same dates):  
     554 → 593 → 629 → 711 → 769  
     QoQ % changes: +7%, +6%, +13%, +8%

2. Compute the population standard deviation of each series  
   a. U.S. Commercial:  
      mean = (13 + 9 + 19 + 13)/4 = 13.5%  
      variance = [(13−13.5)² + (9−13.5)² + (19−13.5)² + (13−13.5)²] / 4  
               = (0.25 + 20.25 + 30.25 + 0.25) / 4 = 12.75  
      σ_commercial ≈ √12.75 ≈ 3.6 pp  
   b. Total customers:  
      mean = (7 + 6 + 13 + 8)/4 = 8.5%  
      variance = [(7−8.5)² + (6−8.5)² + (13−8.5)² + (8−8.5)²] / 4  
               = (2.25 + 6.25 + 20.25 + 0.25) / 4 = 7.25  
      σ_total ≈ √7.25 ≈ 2.7 pp

3. Take the ratio  
   ratio = σ_commercial / σ_total ≈ 3.6 / 2.7 ≈ 1.33

What it implies  
• The U.S. Commercial customer count has about a one‐third higher quarter-to-quarter volatility than the aggregate customer base.  
• In other words, although management cites a robust +65% year-over-year growth in U.S. Commercial customers, the underlying quarterly “runs” are modestly bumpier than total customer growth (≈1.3× more variable), even as the overall trend remains strongly positive."
"For NVIDIA, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, what were the dollar increase in Interest income and the dollar decline in Other income (expense), net, and what was the primary driver identified for the change in Other income (expense), net?","**Answer:**

- **Interest income** rose by \$156 million (from \$359 million in Q1 FY 2025 to \$515 million in Q1 FY 2026).  
  - *“Interest income … \$515 vs. \$359; \$ change = \$156”*  

- **Other income (expense), net** declined by \$255 million (from +\$75 million to –\$180 million).  
  - *“Other income (expense), net … –\$180 vs. \$75; \$ change = –\$255”*  

- The downturn in Other income (expense), net was **primarily driven by unrealized losses in publicly-held equity securities** due to fair-value volatility—most notably in investments such as CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.  
  - *“The change in Other income (expense), net … was primarily driven by unrealized losses in our publicly-held equity securities due to fair value volatility in our investments, particularly CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.”*"
"After deploying Palantir Eval-Driven Automation in AIP as showcased in the DevCon 2 overview, by how much did Wendy's QSCC shorten its supply chain problem resolution cycle and how much did Heineken accelerate its solution build time?","Here’s what the two customers reported:

- Wendy’s QSCC: “We’ve now taken a problem that would go on for weeks and days and fixed it in five minutes…”  
  – i.e. from weeks/days → 5 minutes.

- Heineken: “In three months, the team built what took us three years before.”  
  – i.e. from 3 years → 3 months."
"Management asserted that Palantir delivered an 85% adjusted gross margin, sub-$450 million of adjusted expenses, and $220 million of net income attributable to common stockholders in Q1 2025; what do the reconciliation tables actually report for those three metrics?","Below are the Q1 2025 metrics as pulled directly from the Appendix reconciliation schedules:

1. Adjusted Gross Margin  
   - From “Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit & Adjusted Gross Margin”:  
     – Adjusted Gross Profit: $725,901 thousands  
     – Revenue (per main slides): $884,000 thousands  
     → Adjusted Gross Margin = 725,901 / 884,000 ≈ 82%

2. Adjusted Expenses  
   - From “Reconciliation of Cost of Revenue and Total Operating Expenses to Adjusted Expenses”:  
     – Total Expenses: $707,807 thousands  
     – Less Stock-Based Compensation: $155,339 thousands  
     – Less Employer Payroll Taxes Rel. to SBC: $59,323 thousands  
     → Adjusted Expenses = 707,807 – 155,339 – 59,323 = 493,145 thousands

3. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders  
   - From “Reconciliation of GAAP EPS, Diluted to Adjusted EPS, Diluted”:  
     – Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders = $214,031 thousands

"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the change in Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs expressed as a percentage of the total scheduled long-term debt principal across all maturity buckets?","**Answer:**  
Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs changed as follows:

1.  Total scheduled long-term debt principal (all maturities)  
    = \$1,000 m (2026) + \$1,250 m (2028) + \$1,500 m (2030)  
      + \$1,250 m (2031) + \$1,000 m (2040) + \$2,000 m (2050)  
      +   \$500 m (2060)  
    = **\$8,500 million**

2.  Unamortized discount & issuance costs  
    – As of Jan 26, 2025: **\$37 million**  
    – As of Apr 27, 2025: **\$36 million**  
    (see Note 10 “Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs”)

3.  Percentage of principal  
    – Jan 26, 2025: (37 / 8,500) × 100 ≈ **0.435%**  
    – Apr 27, 2025: (36 / 8,500) × 100 ≈ **0.424%**

4.  Change  
    = 0.424% – 0.435%

  (Source: “After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under … 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs … The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data center products, such as our H200 and GB200.”)  

3) USG “Connected Vehicle” import restrictions – affected NVIDIA product category  
- The USG’s “Connected Vehicle” import-and-sale restrictions would have applied to **certain automotive products** – i.e. NVIDIA’s **Automotive** product line (self-driving and in-vehicle compute platforms).  
  (Source: “For example, the USG adopted ‘Connected Vehicle’ restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States … could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.”)"
"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","Here’s the simple arithmetic:

- Net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation: 61 %¹  
- Three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar: 7.5 %²  

⇒ 61 % ÷ 7.5 % ≃ 8.1  

By contrast, over the past 20 years an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio has been “only” about 2 times as volatile as a U.S. dollar-domestic bond portfolio³. In other words, the investors’ depreciation-to-stress-day ratio (~8 to 1) is more than four times the 2 to 1 volatility differential in unhedged foreign bonds.  

—  
1 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey (2024): a net 61 % expect further dollar depreciation.  
2 J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, Mid-Year Outlook (p. 22): U.S. assets saw simultaneous stock/bond/currency declines on ~7.5 % of trading days (3-year rolling, to 4/30/25).  
3 J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, Mid-Year Outlook (p. 21): an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio has experienced almost 2× the volatility of a U.S.-dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years."
