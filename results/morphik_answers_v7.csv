## 1. Year-over-year growth rates (Q1 2024 → Q1 2025)

| Metric                                            | Q1 2024      | Q1 2025      | Δ (%)           |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Total Revenue (GAAP)                              | \$634 M¹     | \$884 M²     | +39.4 % (~39 %) |
| Total Revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts| \$610 M³     | \$879 M⁴     | +44.1 % (~44 %) |
| US Revenue                                        | \$406 M⁵     | \$628 M⁶     | +54.7 % (~55 %) |

### a) Standard deviation across these three Y/Y rates

Let the three rates be r₁=39 %, r₂=44 %, r₃=55 %.

1. Mean, μ = (39 + 44 + 55) / 3 = 46 %.
2. Variance, σ² = [ (39−46)² + (44−46)² + (55−46)² ] / 3  
   = (49 + 4 + 81) / 3 = 134 / 3 ≃ 44.67  
3. Standard deviation, σ ≃ √44.67 ≃ **6.7 percentage points (pp)**  

> This tells us that the dispersion of Q1 Y/Y revenue growth across total, excl-strategic and US is about ±6.7 pp around its 46 % average.

---

## 2. Q/Q changes in the Rule of 40 score (Q2 2023 → Q1 2025)

From the Appendix “Reconciliation of Rule of 40”:

Quarter | Rule 40
:---|:---
Q2 2023 | 38 %
Q3 2023 | 46 %
Q4 2023 | 54 %
Q1 2024 | 57 %
Q2 2024 | 64 %
Q3 2024 | 68 %
Q4 2024 | 81 %
Q1 2025 | 83 %

Compute each quarter-over-quarter (Q→Q) Δ:

• Q3–Q2 = 46 − 38 = +8 pp  
• Q4–Q3 = 54 − 46 = +8 pp  
• Q1–Q4 = 57 − 54 = +3 pp  
• Q2–Q1 = 64 − 57 = +7 pp  
• Q3–Q2 = 68 − 64 = +4 pp  
• Q4–Q3 = 81 − 68 = +13 pp  
• Q1–Q4 = 83 − 81 = +2 pp  

So the seven sequential changes are:  
[ +8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2 ]   (pp)

---

### a) Standard deviation of these Q/Q changes

1. Mean change, μ = (8 + 8 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 13 + 2) / 7 ≃ 6.429 pp  
2. Variance, σ² = (1/7)·∑(Δᵢ − μ)²  
   = (1/7)·(2.467 + 2.467 +11.76 +0.326 +5.901 +43.18 +19.61)  
   ≃ 12.24  
3. Standard deviation, σ ≃ √12.24 ≃ **3.5 pp**  

> The Q/Q Rule of 40 improvements have a volatility of about ±3.5 pp around their average +6.4 pp/quarter.

---

## 3. Relation to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score (83 %)

- **Steady upward trend**: the Rule of 40 has climbed from 38 % in Q2 2023 to **83 %** in Q1 2025.
- **Low quarter-to-quarter volatility** (σ≈3.5 pp) around that upward trajectory underscores a consistent improvement in the combined growth + margin metric.
- **Moderate revenue growth dispersion** (σ≈6.7 %) across total, ex-strategic and US Y/Y rates shows that while US revenue is outpacing total, all parts are growing strongly and in a relatively tight band.  
- Combined, these volatility metrics illustrate:  
  • **High Rule of 40 (83 %)** in Q1 2025 (well above the 40 % benchmark)  
  • Delivered via **consistently accelerating** revenue growth (39–55 % Y/Y) and **rising margins**,  
  • With **modest quarter-to-quarter step-changes** in Rule of 40 (±3.5 pp σ) and **tight clustering** of revenue growth rates (±6.7 pp σ).  

This consistency of execution is what underpins the record Rule of 40 of **83 %** in Q1 2025.

"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","Below is the step-by-step calculation of operating expense per U.S. commercial customer in Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2025, together with the year-over-year percentage change.

**1. Pull the underlying data**

  • From the “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts” appendix (slide titled “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts”):  
    – Q1 2024 revenue excl. strat. comm. contracts = \$610,440 K  
    – Q1 2025 revenue excl. strat. comm. contracts = \$878,708 K  

  • From the “Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income” appendix (slide titled “Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income”):  
    – Q1 2024 adjusted operating income = \$226,458 K  
    – Q1 2025 adjusted operating income = \$390,710 K  

  • From the “US Commercial Customer Count” slide:  
    – TTM ended March 31, 2024 = 262 customers  
    – TTM ended March 31, 2025 = 432 customers  

**2. Compute total operating expenses**  
Operating expense ≈ (Revenue excl. strat. contracts) – (Adjusted operating income)

  • Q1 2024 operating expense  
    = \$610,440 K – \$226,458 K  
    = \$383,982 K  

  • Q1 2025 operating expense  
    = \$878,708 K – \$390,710 K  
    = \$487,998 K  

**3. Compute expense per U.S. commercial customer**  
Expense per customer = (Operating expense) ÷ (Number of U.S. commercial customers)

  • Q1 2024 expense per customer  
    = \$383,982 K ÷ 262  
    ≈ \$1,466 K per customer  

  • Q1 2025 expense per customer  
    = \$487,998 K ÷ 432  
    ≈ \$1,129 K per customer  

**4. Calculate year-over-year change**  
Percentage change = (New – Old) ÷ Old

  = (\$1,129 K – \$1,466 K) ÷ \$1,466 K  
  ≈ –\$337 K ÷ \$1,466 K  
  ≈ –23.0%

**Conclusion**  
Operating expense per U.S. commercial customer fell from about \$1.47 million in Q1 2024 to \$1.13 million in Q1 2025—a decrease of roughly 23% year-over-year.

"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in Total Other Assets  
   - As of January 26, 2025: Total other assets = \$6,425 million  
   - As of April 27, 2025: Total other assets = \$6,788 million  
   - Dollar change = \$6,788 million − \$6,425 million = **\$363 million**  
   - Reference: Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (Note “Other Assets (Long Term)”),  page 14.

2. Increase in Assumed-Liability Acquisitions

"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","The fair‐value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment as of April 27, 2025 was $1,000 million (see Note 5), whereas the carrying‐value reclassification out of non-marketable equity securities in Q1 FY26 totaled $843 million (see Note 6).  Accordingly, the fair value exceeded the reclassification adjustment by

    $1,000 million – $843 million = $157 million.

• Market Performance (Note 5): CoreWeave began public trading in Q1 FY26, enabling NVIDIA to reclassify $843 million of its investment from “Other Assets, non-marketable equity securities” into marketable securities.  As of April 27, 2025, that position was marked at $1 billion, reflecting robust post-IPO pricing.  
• Comparative Analysis (Note 6): During the three months ended April 27, 2025, NVIDIA recorded net additions of $649 million and $63 million of unrealized gains in its non-marketable portfolio, offset by a $843 million reclassification and $16 million of impairments, leaving a closing balance of $3,240 million.  
• Outlook: With CoreWeave now public, NVIDIA’s future fair‐value mark-to-market gains or losses will flow through “Other income (expense), net” each quarter.  Management has noted in its MD&A that, given the volatility in AI-infrastructure equities, these valuations could fluctuate significantly based on trading volumes, broader market sentiment around cloud GPU providers, and the pace of AI-related deployments."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Below is the analysis “as if” 83% were computed by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the U.S. government revenue Q/Q growth rate (in reality, Palantir’s Rule of 40 uses adjusted operating margin, not free cash flow margin).

1. Adjusted free cash flow margin  
   • Amount: 42%  
   • Calculation: Adjusted free cash flow of \$370 million ÷ Total Q1 2025 revenue of \$884 million ≃ 0.42 (42%)  
   • Source:  
     – “Q1 2025 Highlights” slide: “Adjusted free cash flow of \$370 million; 42% margin.”  
     – Appendix, “Reconciliation of Cash Flow from Operating Activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin.”  

2. U.S. Government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth  
   • Amount: +9% Q/Q  
   • Calculation: (\$373 M – \$257 M) ÷ \$257 M ≃ 0.145 ≃ 15% (Note: the highlight text calls out +9% Q/Q)

 Under the false premise, 42% + 9% = 51%, not 83%.

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","Below is a side-by-side calculation of the two “buckets” and their year-over-year growth rates:

1.  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Three Months Ended Apr 27, 2025 vs. Apr 28, 2024) — Cash flows from operating activities (p. 7):

   • Stock-based compensation expense  
     – Apr 27, 2025: \$1,474 million  
     – Apr 28, 2024: \$1,011 million  

   • Depreciation and amortization  
     – Apr 27, 2025: \$611 million  
     – Apr 28, 2024: \$410 million  

   → Combined (2025): 1,474 + 611 = 2,085   
     Combined (2024): 1,011 + 410 = 1,421  

   → Year-over-year change:  
       Δ = 2,085 – 1,421 = 664 million  
       Growth = 664 / 1,421 ≈ 46.7%  

2.  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (p. 3) and Comprehensive Income (p. 4) — Three Months Ended Apr 27, 2025 vs. Apr 28, 2024:

   • Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities (Comprehensive Income, p. 4)  
     – Apr 27, 2025: + \$139 million  
     – Apr 28, 2024: – \$128 million  

   • Total other income (expense), net (Income Statement, p. 3)  
     – Apr 27, 2025: \$272 million  
     – Apr 28, 2024: \$370 million  

   → Combined (2025): 139 + 272 = 411   
     Combined (2024): (– 128) + 370 = 242  

   → Year-over-year change:  
       Δ = 411 – 242 = 169 million  
       Growth = 169 / 242 ≈ 69.8%  

Comparison:

• “Cash-flow” bucket (stock-based comp + D&A) grew ~46.7% YoY  
• “Income/OCI” bucket (unrealized AFS gain + other income) grew ~69.8% YoY  

Difference in growth rates:  
≈ 69.8% – 46.7% = 23.1 percentage points

"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","Here are the facts straight from NVIDIA’s own 10-Q (Form 10-Q, quarter ended April 27, 2025):

1.  Actual Year-over-Year Change  
    – Q1 FY 2026 (three months ended Apr 27, 2025): Net cash provided by operating activities = \$27,414 million  
    – Q1 FY 2025 (three months ended Apr 28, 2024): Net cash provided by operating activities = \$15,345 million

   Calculation source:  
   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, “Net cash provided by operating activities” line, Three Months Ended Apr 27, 2025 vs. Apr 28, 2024 (page 7 of the PDF).

2.  Drivers of the Shift  
    In Management’s Discussion & Analysis (Item 2, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” page 28), NVIDIA explains:
    •  “Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, **due to higher revenue and timing of cash collections**.”  

   Reference:  
   Form 10-Q, Part I, Item 2 (“Liquidity and Capital Resources”), second paragraph under the three-column table (page 28 of the PDF).

––––––––––––––––––––  
By contrast to any claim that operating cash somehow “fell,” the company’s own Statement of Cash Flows shows a **\$12.1 billion** year-over-year increase, driven entirely by stronger top-line performance and the timing of receipts."
"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","Here’s how the two growth rates compare in Q1 2025:

1. Overall Total Revenue  
   - Q1 2024: \$634,338 K  
   - Q1 2025: \$883,855 K  
   - Y/Y growth = (883,855 − 634,338) / 634,338 ≈ 0.393 → 39%  
   – (Slide “Total revenue grew 39% Y/Y…”; see Financials page)

2. Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts  
   - Q1 2024: \$610,440 K  
   - Q1 2025: \$878,708 K  
   - Y/Y growth = (878,708 − 610,440) / 610,440 ≈ 0.440 → 44%  
   – (Slide “Total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts grew 44% Y/Y…”; see Appendix “Revenue Excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts”)

3. Difference  
   - 44% − 39% = 5 percentage points  

Thus, removing the (small) strategic commercial contracts would not have “tempered” growth at all—on the contrary, ex-strategic revenue grew about 5 points faster than total revenue in Q1 2025."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Below is a summary of the three items you asked for, with our workings and cross-references to the Form 10-Q schedules and notes:

1) Standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value  
   of debt securities by contractual maturity (Apr 27 vs. Jan 26, 2025)  
   (see Form 10-Q, Note 5 “Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities,” page 10, and the maturity breakout on page 11):

   Maturity bucket       Estimated Fair Value (4/27/25) – (1/26/25)   Change ($ mm)  
   ————————————————-​————————————————————————————————————  
   Less than one year    $ 25,781 – $ 18,450 = + 7,331  
   Due in one–five years  $ 26,355 – $ 23,656 = + 2,699  
   Total                   $ 52,136 – $ 42,106 = + 10,030  

   Let Δ₁= 7,331; Δ₂= 2,699; Δ₃= 10,030.  
   • Population variance σ² = [(Δ₁–μ)²+(Δ₂–μ)²+(Δ₃–μ)²] / 3  
     where μ=(7,331+2,699+10,030)/3=6,686.7  
   • σ² = (415,191 + 15,901,512 + 11,177,855) / 3 ≈ 9.164 × 10⁶  
   • σ ≈ √9.164 × 10⁶ ≈ 3,027  

   ⇒ Population σ ≈ $ 3,027 million  
   (If you compute the sample standard deviation, σₛ ≈ 3,707 million.)

2) Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities as of January 26, 2025  
   (see Form 10-Q, Note 5, page 10, “Corporate debt securities” line):

   Amortized cost $ 18,504 million  
   Unrealized gain $ 51 million  
   Unrealized loss ($ 29 million)  
   Estimated FV $ 18,526 million  

   ⇒ Unrealized gain = $ 51 million (Note 5, Jan 26, 2025 column).

3) Percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value  
   (see Form 10-Q, Note 6 “Fair Value of Financial Assets,” page 12):

   Level 1 Money Market Funds  
   ————————————————–  
   Jan 26, 2025 FV = $ 3,760 million  
   Apr 27, 2025 FV = $ 6,522 million  

   % increase = (6,522 – 3,760) / 3,760 × 100  
              ≈ 2,762 / 3,760 × 100  
              ≈ 73.4%

   ⇒ Level 1 money market funds rose by ~ 73.4% over the quarter.

All of the above is reported in Part I, Notes 5 & 6 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and, as noted in each of those notes, “gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates.”"
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","Below is the step-by-step calculation, with line items taken directly from the GAAP operating income and GAAP net income slides for Q3 2024, Q4 2024 and Q1 2025.

1. GAAP Operating Income  
   • Q3 2024: \$113.1 M  
   • Q4 2024: \$ 11.0 M  
   • Q1 2025: \$176.0 M  

   Sequential changes:  
   – Q3→Q4 = \$11.0 M − \$113.1 M = –\$102.1 M  
   – Q4→Q1 = \$176.0 M − \$ 11.0 M = +\$165.0 M  

   Acceleration in operating income = (+\$165.0 M) − (–\$102.1 M)  
   = +\$267.1 M  

2. GAAP Net Income  
   • Q3 2024: \$143.5 M

Calculation of the unbilled percentage:  
- Unbilled RPO (> 1 year) = $160 million  
- Total RPO (> 1 year) = $1,800 million  
- Unbilled % = 160 ÷ 1,800 ≈ 8.9%

**Palantir (Q1 2025)**  
From the “Additional Metrics and Notes” appendix (slide titled “Additional Metrics and Notes”):  

| ($ BILLIONS)      | Q1 2025  |
|------------------|---------:|
| Total RPO        |    $1.90 |
| Short-Term RPO   |    $0.90 |
| Long-Term RPO    |    $1.00 |

Under its ASC 606 practical expedient election Palantir discloses only RPO split by original term.  

Calculation of long-term RPO percentage:  
- Long-Term RPO = $1.00 billion  
- Total RPO = $1.90 billion  
- Long-Term % = 1.00 ÷ 1.90 ≈ 52.6%  

Answer: In Q1 2025, **52.6%** of Palantir’s total remaining performance obligations was classified as long-term under its ASC 606 election (Appendix: “Additional Metrics and Notes”)."
"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?","Between the TTM periods ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025:

1. Global commercial customer growth  
   - TTM Mar 31 2024: 427 customers  
   - TTM Mar 31 2025: 622 customers  
   ⇒ Net new global customers = 622 – 427 = **195**

   (See slide “US Commercial Customer Count,” 262→432.)

3. Non-U.S. commercial customer additions

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","**Answer:**

1.  **Historical growth in operating lease obligations**  
    In Note 14 to NVIDIA’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (see “Operating Lease Obligations” table on p. 21 of the 10-Q), the future minimum operating lease obligations by fiscal year are:  
     
    | Fiscal year                        | 2026¹    | 2027    | 2028    |
    |------------------------------------|---------:|--------:|--------:|
    | Operating lease obligations (in $ millions) | 274      | 346     | 349     |
     
    To compute the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2026 to 2028:  
     
    \[
      \text{CAGR}
      = \Bigl(\tfrac{\text{Obligation}_{2028}}{\text{Obligation}_{2026}}\Bigr)^{\tfrac{1}{2}}
        - 1
      = \bigl(\tfrac{349}{274}\bigr)^{0.5} - 1
      \approx 1.1277 - 1
      = 0.1277
      \;\approx 12.8\%
    \]
     
    – **Beginning value (BV)** = \$ 274 million (FY 2026)  
    – **Ending value (EV)** = \$ 349 million (FY 2028)  
    – **Number of periods (n)** = 2 years  
     
2.  **Forward-looking commitments**  
    In the same Note 14 (p. 21), NVIDIA discloses that  
    > “Between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of \$7.4 billion primarily of data center and office operating leases, with lease terms of 2 to 15.5 years.”  
     
    – This \$ 7.4 billion in **new** operating lease commitments far exceeds the \$ 349 million obligation shown for FY 2028 alone and highlights management’s expectation of a significant expansion of its data center and office footprint over that period.  
     
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
¹ The FY 2026 obligation of \$ 274 million excludes the first quarter of FY 2026 (per the table header)."
"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","**Answer:**

1.  **Quarter-over-quarter growth rates (TTM‐ended Mar 31, 2025)**  
   – US Commercial Customer Count, TTM ended  
     • Q1 ’25 vs Q4 ’24: (432 – 382)/382 = 13.1%  
     • Q4 ’24 vs Q3 ’24: (382 – 321)/321 = 18.9%  
     • Q3 ’24 vs Q2 ’24: (321 – 295)/295 = 8.8%  
     • Q2 ’24 vs Q1 ’24: (295 – 262)/262 = 12.6%  
     → {+13%, +19%, +9%, +13%}  
     (Slide “US Commercial Customer Count,” Q1 Financials)  

   – Total Customer Count, TTM ended  
     • Q1 ’25 vs Q4 ’24: (769 – 711)/711 = 8.2%  
     • Q4 ’24 vs Q3 ’24: (711 – 629)/629 = 13.0%  
     • Q3 ’24 vs Q2 ’24: (629 – 593)/593 = 6.1%  
     • Q2 ’24 vs Q1 ’24: (593 – 554)/554 = 7.0%  
     → {+8%, +13%, +6%, +7%}  
     (Slide “Customer Count,” Q1 Financials)  

2.  **Standard‐deviation calculation**  
   Using the population formula for four quarterly rates:  

   • US Commercial σpop = sqrt[∑(ri–r̄)² / 4]  
     = sqrt[(–0.005)²+(0.055)²+(–0.045)²+(–0.005)² / 4]  
     ≈ 3.6 percentage points  

   • Total customers σpop = sqrt[(–0.015)²+(0.045)²+(–0.025)²+(–0.005)² / 4]  
     ≈ 2.7 percentage points  

3.  **Volatility ratio**  
   \[σpop(US Commercial) / σpop(Total)\] ≈ 3.6% / 2.7% ≈ 1.33  

4.  **Implication**  
   A ratio of ~1.33× indicates that quarter-to-quarter swings in the US commercial customer count are about one-third more volatile than those for the total customer base—even as management reports a robust +65% Y/Y increase in US commercial customers (Slide “US commercial continues to accelerate in Q1 2025…”). This elevated volatility underscores that commercial expansion, while very strong on an annual basis, exhibits larger periodic fluctuations than the broader customer cohort."
"For NVIDIA, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, what were the dollar increase in Interest income and the dollar decline in Other income (expense), net, and what was the primary driver identified for the change in Other income (expense), net?","The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income show that, for Q1 FY 2026 vs. Q1 FY 2025:

- Interest income rose by $515 million − $359 million = **+$156 million**.  
- Other income (expense), net moved from +$75 million to –$180 million  = **–$255 million**.  

Management explains that the drop in Other income (expense), net was “primarily driven by unrealized losses in our publicly-held equity securities due to fair-value volatility in our investments, particularly CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.” (Q1 Commentary, pp. 26–27)."
"After deploying Palantir Eval-Driven Automation in AIP as showcased in the DevCon 2 overview, by how much did Wendy's QSCC shorten its supply chain problem resolution cycle and how much did Heineken accelerate its solution build time?","Here’s what our two flagship customers achieved once they hooked Eval-Driven Automation into AIP:  

1. Wendy’s QSCC (Quality Supply Chain Co-op)  
   • Prior state: supply-chain break-fixes dragged out for days or even weeks.  
   • With AIP Eval-Driven Automation: end-to-end resolution in 5 minutes.  
   → That’s effectively a 99 %+ reduction in turnaround time, freeing supply-chain teams to focus on exception management rather than firefighting.  

2. Heineken  
   • Prior state: building advanced AI-driven delivery and shipping logic took roughly 3 years.  
   • With AIP Eval-Driven Automation: the same end-to-end solution was built in 3 months.  
   → A 12× acceleration in time-to-value, letting them iterate on new capabilities in the time it once took just to spec them out.  

Both examples underscore how Eval-Driven Automation tightens feedback loops in the Ontology—dramatically compressing cycle times, improving operational throughput, and letting customer teams redeploy headcount from manual troubleshooting into higher-value process improvements."

| **Adjusted Gross Margin** *(Adjusted Gross Profit ÷ Revenue)*         | **82 %**     |

- Calculation:  
  • Start with GAAP gross profit of \$710.9 M.  
  • Add back \$15.0 M of stock-based compensation in cost of revenue.  
  • Divide the resulting \$725.9 M by Q1 2025 revenue (\$883.9 M) ⇒ 82 %.

- Calculation:  
  • Take GAAP total expenses of \$707.8 M.  
  • Subtract the \$155.3 M of stock-based compensation expense and \$59.3 M of related employer payroll taxes.  
  • Result is \$493.1 M of non-GAAP “adjusted expenses.”

"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the change in Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs expressed as a percentage of the total scheduled long-term debt principal across all maturity buckets?","Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025 NVIDIA’s gross long-term debt outstanding (face value) across all maturity buckets remained at $8.5 billion.  Over that same period, its unamortized debt discount and issuance costs declined from $37 million to $36 million (see Note 10 – Debt, “Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs”):  

• Total scheduled debt principal (face value) at both dates:  
  – 3.20% due 2026 … $1,000 million  
  – 1.55% due 2028 … 1,250  
  – 2.85% due 2030 … 1,500  
  – 2.00% due 2031 … 1,250

  – 3.50% due 2050 … 2,000  
  – 3.70% due 2060 … 500  
  = 8,500 million total principal  

• Unamortized discount & issuance costs:  
  – Jan 26, 2025 … $(37) million  
  – Apr 27, 2025 … $(36) million  

Expressed as a fraction of the $8.5 billion face amount:  

| Date        | Unamortized Discount ($ mm) | % of Principal = (Discount ÷ 8,500) |
|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Jan 26, 2025| 37                          | 37 / 8,500 ≈ 0.435%                 |
| Apr 27, 2025| 36                          | 36 / 8,500 ≈ 0.424%                 |

Change in carrying unamortized discount as a percentage of principal  
= 0.424% – 0.435%  ≈ –0.011 percentage points (i.e., a decline of about 1.1 basis points).

- 14.3% of income before tax for Q1 FY 2026  
- (Comparative: 13.9% for Q1 FY 2025; vs. the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate)

**Four primary drivers cited for the rate being below 21%**  
1. Foreign-derived intangible income deduction (FDII)  
2. Stock-based compensation tax benefit  
3. Income earned in jurisdictions with statutory rates below 21%  
4. U.S. federal research tax credit

  - Graphics: \$4.5 B, +33% Y/Y  
  - Automotive: +72% Y/Y  
- Gross margin declined to 60.5% (from 78.4% in Q1 FY 2025), driven largely by a \$4.5 B H20 inventory charge  

**Forward-looking commentary**  
> “Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all available information.”

## 2. Palantir’s Estimated Long-Term Tax Rate for Market-Vesting SARs

In the reconciliation of GAAP net income to “Net Income When Excluding One-Time SAR-Related Expenses” (Appendix), Palantir applies:

> **23.0%**   
> (Estimated long-term annual effective tax rate used to calculate the income tax effect of market-vesting SARs.)

**Context & comparative analysis**  
- Q1 2025 GAAP EPS: \$0.08; Adjusted EPS (ex-SAR): \$0.13  
- Net income, ex-SAR adjustments: \$164.7 M (Q4 2024) → \$214.0 M (Q1 2025)  
- Palantir’s “Rule of 40” hit 83% in Q1 2025 vs. 81% in Q4 2024  
- US revenue up 55% Y/Y to \$628 M; US commercial up 71% Y/Y to \$255 M  

**Forward-looking use of the rate**  
- The 23.0% rate “excludes certain non-cash items (e.g., stock-based compensation) and is used to provide consistency across periods by eliminating one-time or valuation-allowance effects.”

1. Interest income as a share of gross profit  
   - From the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Note 1, p. 3):  
     • Q1 FY 2026 (ended Apr 27, 2025):  
       – Interest income = \$515 million  
       – Gross profit = \$26,668 million  
       → \$515 / \$26,668 = 1.93% of gross profit  
     • Q1 FY 2025 (ended Apr 28, 2024):  
       – Interest income = \$359 million  
       – Gross profit = \$20,406 million  
       → \$359 / \$20,406 = 1.76% of gross profit  
     • Year-over-year change = 1.93% – 1.76% = +0.17 percentage points  
   - (Alternatively, using the “Results of Operations” percentages on p. 25:  
     Interest income of 1.2% of revenue over a gross-profit margin of 60.5% ⇒ 1.98% of gross profit, versus 1.4%/78.4% ⇒ 1.79%, for a +0.19 ppt gain.)

2. Year-over-year percentage increase in R&D expenses  
   - From the Operating Expenses table (p. 27):  
     • Q1 FY 2026 R&D = \$3,989 million  
     • Q1 FY 2025 R&D = \$2,720 million  
     • Change = \$3,989 – \$2,720 = \$1,269 million  
     • % Change = \$1,269 / \$2,720 = 46.7% ⇒ **+47%**

Summary  
- Interest income’s share of gross profit rose by roughly **0.17 percentage points** year-over-year (1.76% → 1.93%).  
- By contrast, R&D spending jumped **47%** over the same period."
"What manufacturing lead times has NVIDIA previously experienced, which fiscal quarter saw gross margins negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material, and in which quarter are sample shipments of Blackwell Ultra expected to commence?","1.

|   | Apr 27, 2025 | Jan 26, 2025 | Δ (QoQ) |
|---|--------------:|-------------:|--------:|
| Current assets (A)            |   \$ 89,935 M |   \$ 80,126 M |  + \$ 9,809 M |
| Current liabilities (B)       |   \$ 26,542 M |   \$ 18,047 M |  + \$ 8,495 M |
| Net working capital (A − B)   |   \$ 63,393 M |   \$ 62,079 M |  + \$ 1,314 M |

Calculation:  
Net working capital Apr 27, 2025 = 89,935 − 26,542 = 63,393   
Net working capital Jan 26, 2025 = 80,126 − 18,047 = 62,079   
Δ NWC = 63,393 − 62,079 = **\$ 1,314 million**  

**2. Increase in Retained Earnings**  
(from Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity, page 6)

|   | Jan 26, 2025 | Apr 27, 2025 | Δ (QoQ)      |
|---|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| Retained earnings | \$ 68,038 M | \$ 72,158 M | + \$ 4,120 M |

Δ Retained earnings = 72,158 − 68,038 = **\$ 4,120 million**  

**3. Capex as a % of the Retained Earnings Increase**  
(from Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, page 7)

|   | Three Months Ended Apr 27, 2025 |
|----------------------------------:|--------------------:|
| Purchases of property & equipment and intangible assets | \$(1,227 M) |

Percentage consumed = 1,227 / 4,120 ≈ **29.8 %**  

– Calculation method:  
  • Numerator: investing cash outflow “Purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets” = \$1,227 M  
  • Denominator: retained earnings increase = \$4,120 M  
  • % = (1,227 ÷ 4,120) × 100 ≈ 29.8 %

"Under footnote 11 in J.P. Morgan’s midyear report article “IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?” what is the difference in percentage points between the net percentage of investors expecting continued dollar depreciation and the year-to-date share of trading days in 2025 with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar as defined by the market-credibility metric in the “Tracking the market’s perception of the dollar” section?","Here’s how the two figures break down (see pages 21–22 of the 2025 Mid-Year Outlook):

1. Footnote 11 (page 21) cites the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey, which shows a net 61% of investors now expect the U.S. dollar to *continue* depreciating against major currencies.  
   - Source: “Nearly 70% of investors surveyed think the dollar is ‘overvalued,’ and a **net 61%**, the highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to depreciate.”¹  

2. The “Tracking the market’s perception of the dollar” metric (page 22) defines market credibility as the % of trading days on which U.S. stocks, bonds **and** the U.S. dollar all lose value.  Year-to-date through April 30, 2025, that share is **5%**.²  
   - Source: Bloomberg Finance L.P., data as of April 30, 2025.  

Calculation of the difference:  
  61% (net % expecting further depreciation)  
−  5% (YTD % of days with simultaneous declines)  
= 56 percentage points

"In Q1 FY26, following the USG’s April 9, 2025 export licensing requirements that diminished demand for H20 products, what percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales did NVIDIA’s related excess inventory charge represent, and by how many percentage points did that percentage exceed Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin?","Below is the step-by-step calculation and the supporting references:

1. NVIDIA’s H20 pre-licensing sales and excess-inventory charge (Q1 FY26)  
 – “Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the new export-licensing requirements. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations…”  
  • Source: NVIDIA Q1 FY26 Form 10-Q, Item 2 “MD&A – Recent Developments…,” p. 22.

2. Compute the charge as a percentage of pre-licensing sales  
 – Charge ÷ Pre-licensing sales = $4.5 billion ÷ $4.6 billion ≈ 0.9783  
 – ≈ 97.8 %

3. Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin  
 – “Q1 2025 adjusted operating income was $391 M, representing a margin of 44%.”  
  • Source: Palantir Q1 2025 Investor Presentation, “Q1 2025 Highlights” slide.

4. Percentage-point difference  
 – 97.8 % (NVIDIA charge / H20 sales)  
 – – 44 % (Palantir adj. op. margin)  
 = 53.8 percentage points

Summary:  
• NVIDIA’s $4.5 billion excess-inventory charge equals ~97.8 % of the $4.6 billion in pre-licensing H20 sales (10-Q MD&A, p. 22).  
• That 97.8 % exceeds Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin (44 %, Q1 2025 slides) by approximately 53.8 percentage points."
